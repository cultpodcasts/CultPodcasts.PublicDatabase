      "title": "Dramatic development in South Korea cult \u0027Providence\u0027 as a top leader arrested",
      "description": "There has been a major development since 7NEWS Spotlight released our global investigation last week - The Cult Next Door. Warrants have been issued for a  number of suspected accomplices in the case against Providence cult leader  Jeong Myung Seok (JMS)\n\nOne of those was JMS\u2019s second in a charge, his successor a woman called Pastor Joeun, she\u2019s accused of luring and grooming women to have sexual intercourse with the now 78 year old. \n\nJust as Ghislaine Maxwell procured young women for Jeffrey Epstein Pastor Joeun is accused of doing virtually the same thing for JMS. \n\nLast week, we released the full documentary, which you can watch here:\nhttps://youtu.be/WKYhDKCm1Io\n\nThe Cult Next Door. 7NEWS Spotlight\u2019s global investigation into a dangerous \u2018religious\u2019 group. They were two young Aussie women, enticed by faith and friendship, welcomed into a community made to feel safe and loved. But things quickly changed. \nThis week, in a 7NEWS Spotlight global investigation, for the first time the chilling true stories of the women who escaped a dangerous cult.\nBranded as a religious movement, Providence has been operating in Australia since 1997, and is accused of recruiting young women in local shopping centres and universities then brainwashing them to travel to South Korea to become spiritual brides of a criminal.\n\nSpotlight has uncovered allegations of serious crimes and brainwashing by the outfit which is registered as a charitable organisation in Australia.\n7NEWS Europe correspondent Sarah Greenhalgh this week joins the 7NEWS Spotlight team and, in a world first, travels deep inside the secretive cult compound in South Korea to confront the leaders. \n\n\u201CWe\u2019ve been investigating this cult for six months and it has led us across Australia, to the US and South Korea,\u201D said Sarah. \u201CWhen we started, we knew there were serious allegations of coercive control and various forms of abuse, but we had no idea just how sinister this organisation is. What we\u2019ve uncovered now involves the Australian Federal Police.\n\n\u201CProvidence was founded in 1978 by self-professed \u2018messiah\u2019 Jeong Meong-Seok (JMS). The group claims to be a Christian religious movement with more than 40,000 Korean members and a presence in more than 70 countries including Australia. The \u2018churches\u2019 we\u2019ve visited in Melbourne and Sydney are just like those in South Korea \u2013 there\u2019s no signage, no lists of services, certainly no standard, \u2018open door\u2019 church policy. Instead, the faithful meet behind frosted glass, using secret pin codes for access.\n\n\u201CProvidence is a cult. And the impact it has had on so many young women\u2019s lives is enormous.\u201D\n\nSubscribe to 7NEWS Spotlight for the latest video \u00BB http://7news.link/SpotlightSubscribe\nConnect with 7NEWS Spotlight online\nVisit \u00BB https://7news.com.au/spotlight\n7NEWS Spotlight Podcast \u00BB http://smarturl.it/7NewsSpotlight\nFacebook \u00BB https://www.facebook.com/7newsSpotlight/\nTwitter \u00BB https://twitter.com/7newsSpotlight/\nInstagram \u00BB https://instagram.com/7newsSpotlight/\n\n7NEWS combines the trusted and powerful news brands including Sunrise, The Morning Show, The Latest, and 7NEWS.com.au, delivering unique, engaging and continuous coverage on the issues that matter most to Australians.
