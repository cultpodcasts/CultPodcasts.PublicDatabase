In Joshimath, where the revered Swami Brahmananda Saraswati (\u0027Guru Dev\u0027) had re-established a monastery, Paul discovered rare books about him. To translate them, he studied Hindi and Sanskrit. From Guru Dev\u0027s disciples and other sources, he obtained more biographical material and photographs of Guru Dev. The translations, published in a three-volume set, include the original Devanagari text. Paul\u0027s biography of Maharishi was published in 1996. New editions feature more information about Maharishi\u0027s life, his association with Guru Dev, his passing in 2008, and many more photographs. Paul is writing a fourth book about Guru Dev, an in-depth re-examination of his life and teachings.\n\nPaul has written other books about his travels and research. He has created ebooks on various topics including the LA blues group, Canned Heat. \n\nMany know of Paul through his FB groups \u0027Roots of TM\u0027 and \u0027Guru Dev - Swami Brahmananda Saraswati\u2019.\u201D",
