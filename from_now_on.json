      "description": "What does it mean to be in and escape a \u201Ccult of one\u201D? How can we change the conversation around narcissistic abuse to support survivors and break the cycle of harm? In this episode, Lisa welcomes Vanessa Reiser, a therapist, survivor, and author of Narcissistic Abuse: A Therapist\u2019s Guide to Identifying, Escaping, and Healing from Toxic and Manipulative People. Together, they confront the devastating realities of narcissistic abuse, detail the Tell a Therapist\u2019s Hierarchy of Restoration and the steps survivors need to take when trying to break free. Vanessa shares her groundbreaking insights on the parallels between narcissistic relationships and cult dynamics, unveiling how narcissists use tactics like love bombing, future faking, mirroring, triangulation, and isolation to manipulate their prey. Lisa and Vanessa discuss the narcissist playbook and how they use many forms of punishment to control their \u201Ccult of one.\u201D Through Vanessa\u2019s book and personal journey, she emphasizes the importance of recognizing abuse, reclaiming autonomy, and building a support system to foster healing. This episode is a powerful call to action, challenging the narratives that glorify toxic relationships, naming abuse, stopping an ecosystem of chaos, and cultivating a life of radical self-love. Survivors deserve more than survival\u2014they deserve autonomy, joy, and respect. From now on\u2026 I will sit in truth.
