      "description": "Dr. Camille Lewis attended BJU in the 90s, where she earned both her bachelor\u0027s and master\u0027s degrees. She joined the faculty at BJU and completed her Ph.D. from Indiana University. In 2007, she left BJU after being given an ultimatum: either resign or permit the BJU daycare to spank her 2-year-old son. She chose her son. In this episode, she provides an overview of the history of Bob Jones University. She is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Communication Studies at Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina. She holds a Ph.D. from Indiana University in Rhetorical Studies with a minor in American Studies. Her book, \u0027 Romancing the Difference: Kenneth Burke, Bob Jones University, and the Rhetoric of Religious Fundamentalism \u0027, was a scholarly attempt to stretch the boundaries of both Kenneth Burke\u2019s rhetorical theory on tragedy and comedy as well as stretch conservative evangelical\u2019s separatist frames. Her second book, \u0027 White Nationalism and Faith: Statements and Counter-Statements \u0027, tracks the religious arguments for and against white nationalism in America since the Civil War. She is currently working on a manuscript entitled Klandamentalism. After nearly twenty years in the classroom, Camille is thrilled to be teaching Rhetoric \u0026 Strategy, Argumentation, Rhetorical Criticism, Great Speeches, and Public Speaking at Furman.
