      "description": "Join Andrew Pledger as he speaks with survivors who have endured harm at Bob Jones University, a fundamentalist college known for its strict regulations and emphasis on indoctrination, conformity, and control. The influence of BJU extends far beyond its gates, serving as the hub for numerous churches, schools, and camps operated by BJU graduates that continue to propagate harmful teachings and controlling dynamics. This podcast provides a platform for survivors to share their experiences at BJU and its affiliated organizations. - Subscribe to stay updated - Premiering early 2024Connect with Andrew PledgerSocial Media: https://andrewpledger.mypixieset.com/linksJoin my Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/4ndrewpledger Hosted on Acast.
