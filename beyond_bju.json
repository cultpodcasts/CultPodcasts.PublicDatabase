      "description": "Leah Worley\u2019s time at BJU was marked by an invasive surveillance regime and a suffocating culture of authoritarianism. Targeted for her appearance, she found herself under constant scrutiny, with every aspect of her identity dissected and judged under the unforgiving lens of the university\u0027s rigid moral compass. Leah recounts chilling episodes of being stalked, publicly shamed, sexually harassed, and subjected to relentless intimidation by authority figures determined to break her down. Yet, amidst this turmoil, Leah\u2019s narrative is also one of awakening and empowerment. She describes the turning point when she decided to take control of her life, employing strategies to evade undue surveillance and reclaim her autonomy. This episode is a rallying cry for all those who have felt the weight of coercive control, a testament to the power of personal agency, and a reminder that even in the face of adversity, hope and renewal are possible.

      "description": "In this episode, we delve into the experiences of Joshua Bellis, whose family was intricately entwined with Bob Jones University (BJU). He shares his experiences of growing up as a missionary kid in Canada. His parents were missionaries with the Gospel Fellowship Association, a mission agency operated by BJU. Joshua also shares the story of his grandfather (James Bellis) who, despite his dedicated service to BJU, was neglected in his time of need, leading to a serious injury. Shockingly, it took a lawsuit threat for the institution to take responsibility. He also recounts a disturbing incident involving his uncle, a high-ranking BJU member, and the university\u0027s mishandling of a scandal, revealing the institution\u0027s prioritization of image over moral responsibility. Finally, Joshua opens up about his father\u0027s fall from leadership. Join us as we explore these stories of betrayal, disillusionment, and the struggle for justice.

In this updated episode, I add some of the recommendations section. The GRACE report is a 301-page report on the mishandling of sex abuse allegations at Bob Jones University. The report shows Bob Jones University responding to rape and abuse claims with woeful ignorance of state law, a near-complete lack of training in psychology and trauma counseling best practices, and an overarching campus culture that blames women and girls for any abuse they suffer, and which paints all sexuality-from rape to consensual sex-as equivalent misdeeds.

Listen to the IndoctriNation Podcast on Apple Podcasts , Spotify , and other platforms . Andrew Pledger is a content creator, activist, and writer who uses social media to share his story and inspire others. He is a religious trauma survivor who was homeschooled K-12 and raised in a fundamentalist Christian cult (Independent Fundamental Baptist movement). He brings awareness to spiritual and religious abuse. Being a part of the LGBTQ\u0026#43; community and experiencing religious trauma has inspired him to pursue psychology to help survivors. After being homeschooled, he found his way to Bob Jones University. He attended the fundamentalist Christian college for over three years until he was expelled in his last semester for sharing his story and denouncing fundamentalist teachings. Andrew comes on the show to share his experiences of the level of control and mental abuse he experienced at Bob Jones University. Andrew opens up to Rachel about his complicated relationship with his 2nd generation IFB parents, he compares the high-control culture he grew up within his family with the complete authoritarian control of Bob Jones University. Together Andrew and Rachel discuss the psychological impacts on adolescents living under the constant surveillance and harsh judgment of fundamentalism.
