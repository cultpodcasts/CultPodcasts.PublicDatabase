      "description": "After Senator Katie Britt\u0027s response to the State of the Union went viral for all the wrong reasons, Jess Piper wrote about how her voice was all too familiar. It had all the hallmarks of a \u0022well-practiced fundie baby voice.\u0022\r\n\r\nThat voice, famously used by Michelle Duggar and so many others, is a phenomenon worth exploring, and there\u0027s no one better than Jess to speak to about it. \r\n\r\nYou can read Jess\u0027 article here: https://jesspiper.substack.com/p/the-fundie-baby-voice",
