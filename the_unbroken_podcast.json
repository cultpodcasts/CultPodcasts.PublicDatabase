I did what I had to do to ensure my daughters were safe. But eventually I had to give up the fight. This problem is not just a problem that I personally go through but so many victims of domestic violence and sex trafficking do. But if we\u0027re not talking about it people are never going to know that it\u0027s happening and there will be no way to fix the system. No survivor should look up at a judge and see a formal client. No survivor should lose custody of their children to their abuser. We need to fix the systems so they protect the victims and not the abusers.

And there were so many things that made me stay period from being able to make excuses for why it was happening or being more terrified of going back home to my parents\u2019 house there was always something that made me stay. I thought the wedding would change everything. But of course, it did not. I learned a lot of lessons with that marriage. And I\u0027m glad I made it out alive.

And I think one of the most difficult things is looking over the life that me and him shared there were hundreds of people that witnessed the abuse and did nothing. It again was something that I needed to save myself from. And while I started going to the support groups to start to talk about him I ended up talking about my parents instead. Because of that night I found the strength to ultimately start to see through all the psychological abuse that I was going through with my parents and started to realize that nothing in my life was normal.  1-800-799-7233 - Domestic Violence Hotline  The Unbroken Podcast | Linktree  ---   Send in a voice message: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/theunbrokenpodcast924/message Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/theunbrokenpodcast924/support",

We already give out so much more information then we want to without even knowing it. I\u0027m hoping that this episode can open people\u0027s minds so they start to realize exactly how we can end sex trafficking. I don\u0027t have all the answers.
