      "description": "If someone who seemed larger than life offered you a glimpse of a brand-new self, would you believe it? Keith Raniere had the ability to make the people around him see a vision of hope and success with his group, NXIVM. For a moment, India Oxenberg saw it too. However, NXIVM\u0027s true purpose was darker than anything she could have ever imagined. Author and documentary producer India Oxenberg details her seven-year experience with the NXIVM cult and explains how she was able to break free. She shares her journey of healing and finding her voice and discusses the joys of her life today. India has released a documentary about the story of her survival and escape from NXIVM entitled Seduced: Inside the NXIVM Cult, as well as a memoir about her journey, Still Learning . \u0026#xfeff; Follow Emily on Instagram: @realemilycompagno If you have a story or topic we should feature on the FOX True Crime Podcast, send us an email at: truecrimepodcast@fox.com Learn more about your ad choices.
