Melanie and her sister Miranda, formerly the Wilking Sisters, faced a turning point when Miranda was drawn into the 7M organization. In a courageous move, Melanie and her parents went live on Instagram to expose the situation. Melanie shares her family\u0027s journey since the docuseries, her experiences with Shekinah, and the emotional toll of Miranda\u0027s decision to stay. She discusses their ongoing efforts to reconnect with her sister and the important lessons learned along the way. Forgive Me For I Have Followed continues the exploration from Netflix\u2019s hit Dancing for the Devil documentary series by delving deeper into the personal stories of those affected by Robert Shinn, Shekinah Church, and 7M Films. We will focus on the experiences of victims and their families, address urgent questions raised in the documentary, and gather insights from former members and dancers. Our goal is to uncover strategies for combating abuse and ensuring that controlling, cult-like communities are held accountable for their actions. *The following is based on actual events.
