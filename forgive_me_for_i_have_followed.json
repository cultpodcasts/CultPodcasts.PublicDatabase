      "description": "Aubrey shares his experiences with Shekinah Church and his role in creating content for 7M Films. He reflects on some of the most poignant and unusual moments he encountered at the church. Aubrey also discusses the church\u0027s reaction to the Wilking parents\u0027 TikTok plea and how his perspective began to shift. Finally, he talks about his experience watching the documentary and the changes in his life since leaving the church. Forgive Me For I Have Followed continues the exploration from Netflix\u2019s hit Dancing for the Devil documentary series by delving deeper into the personal stories of those affected by Robert Shinn, Shekinah Church, and 7M Films. We will focus on the experiences of victims and their families, address urgent questions raised in the documentary, and gather insights from former members and dancers. Our goal is to uncover strategies for combating abuse and ensuring that controlling, cult-like communities are held accountable for their actions. *The following is based on actual events.
