      "description": "How do you know if you\u0027re in a cult? And, how does an open society confront propaganda, brainwashing, and the rise of fascism? That\u0027s the undercurrent of this conversation with noted cultic studies expert, Alexandra Stein, PhD.\n\n \n\nAlexandra Stein is a writer and educator specializing in the social psychology of ideological extremism and other dangerous social relationships. She brings an extraordinary lens to cultic studies with her attachment-based approach, which helps us understand how an average person \u2013 privileged and educated, even \u2013 can fall under the influence of a high-demand group. \u00A0",
