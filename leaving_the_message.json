Both John and Nate reflect on their upbringing in churches that, while providing positive community experiences, also propagated questionable theology and practices. They delve into the history of these movements, the blending of religion and politics, and the potential dangers of the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) and similar groups. The conversation also touches on the commercialization and politicization of Christianity, the misuse of scripture, and the rise of Christian nationalism. \n\n\nAs the discussion progresses, John and Nate express concerns about how these movements distort the message of Jesus and exploit religious beliefs for political agendas. They highlight the importance of returning to biblical teachings and avoiding the manipulation of scripture for personal or political gain. Both participants acknowledge the struggles of those who have left these movements, often feeling disillusioned or betrayed by their church experiences. The episode concludes with a call for a more authentic and scripturally grounded faith, free from the distortions and excesses that have come to characterize much of modern charismatic Christianity.",

Movements in NAR history, such as Latter Rain, opposed racial integration in media, specifically targeting shows like I Love Lucy and The Adventures of Superman for promoting interracial relationships and equality.

      "description": "Support the show:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/branham\n\nAvailable on Spotify, Google, and Apple Podcasts:\nhttps://william-branham.org/podcast\n\nCharles and John examine the intricate and often contradictory rules established by William Branham for church conduct, drawing comparisons between his practices and those of the early Christian church. The discussion centers on how Branham\u0027s rigid church order contrasted sharply with his condemnation of the Catholic Church\u0027s formalized worship. The irony lies in Branham\u0027s creation of equally, if not more, restrictive rules for his followers, which transformed the church environment into one of strict control and limited personal freedom in worship. \n\nAs Branham\u0027s influence grew, he introduced church order as a framework to regulate church governance and behavior, ostensibly to address excesses in charismatic worship. However, this framework also served to consolidate power, limiting the roles and influence of other ministers and prophets within the movement. The enforcement of these rules by deacons, who acted as enforcers directly under Branham\u0027s authority, led to an atmosphere of fear and strict adherence to conduct codes. This structure allowed Branham to maintain control over his followers and ensured that his version of worship and church governance prevailed, even after his death, shaping the practices of the message churches that followed. This appears to be the primary reason that leaders of the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) admit that Branham \u0022went astray.\u0022 \n\nCharles\u0027 Book:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Come-Out-Her-People-1930-1965/dp/B0CZRMM8WQ",

Mystika, a licensed mental health clinician and street preacher from Upstate New York, discusses her involvement in the NAR movement and the challenges she faced. She describes how she was drawn to the movement, believing it to be the true representation of the church. Mystika recounts how she was identified as an evangelist by a church leader and how this recognition made her feel valued and significant. She explains that her involvement in the movement led her to become deeply involved in deliverance ministry, where she dealt with people believed to be demon-possessed.\n\n\nMystika also discusses the fear-based environment of the NAR church, where members were constantly on guard against demons and witchcraft. She describes bizarre and unsettling incidents, such as a church leader manifesting a \u0022python spirit\u0022 and the ensuing chaotic deliverance session. Despite the support and recognition she received, Mystika eventually began to question the teachings and practices of the NAR movement. Her growing doubts, combined with prayer and the support of concerned friends, helped her break free from the church. Mystika emphasizes the importance of personal Bible study and understanding scripture to avoid being misled by false teachings.",

      "description": "More Information:\nhttps://william-branham.org/site/research/people/john_wimber\n\nJohn Wimber was a significant figure in charismatic Christianity, playing a pivotal role in the Vineyard movement and the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR). His theology emphasized supernatural experiences, particularly through miraculous healings and prophetic utterances, which he referred to as \u0022signs and wonders.\u0022 Wimber\u0027s work at Fuller Theological Seminary, alongside C. Peter Wagner, contributed to the growth of \u0022power evangelism,\u0022 a method that integrated charismatic practices with traditional evangelicalism. Wimber\u0027s approach was heavily influenced by Kingdom Now theology and the Pentecostal movement, and he advocated for Christians to exert dominion over the earthly realm. Despite being celebrated for revitalizing congregations, Wimber\u0027s legacy is also criticized for its uncritical embrace of questionable prophetic figures, such as the Kansas City Prophets, and its emphasis on experiential spirituality, which some argue overshadowed sound biblical exegesis.\n\nWimber\u0027s leadership of the Vineyard movement was instrumental in shaping modern charismatic Christianity. The Toronto Blessing, a revival characterized by extreme emotional and physical manifestations, drew criticism for its bizarre phenomena, leading Wimber to distance himself from the movement. Nevertheless, his influence persisted through the endorsement of controversial figures like Paul Cain and Bob Jones. Wimber\u0027s impact on the International House of Prayer (IHOP-KC) and his connection to Latter Rain doctrines solidified his role in modern NAR theology. His legacy of promoting supernatural experiences as a core aspect of faith continues to shape evangelical and charismatic movements, though not without significant scrutiny regarding its theological and pastoral soundness.\n\n00:00 Introduction  \n00:15 John Wimber\u0027s Background and Influence on Charismatic Christianity  \n01:16 The Theology of Power Evangelism and Kingdom Now  \n02:48 Wimber\u2019s Connections with C.

Central to this doctrine is the belief that Christians are divinely mandated to seize control of seven key societal spheres\u2014religion, family, education, government, media, arts and entertainment, and business\u2014to establish a dominionist Christian society. Explore how this mandate is rooted in dominion theology, influenced by movements such as the Latter Rain, and examines the figure of Loren Cunningham, founder of Youth With A Mission (YWAM), whose vision helped solidify this ideological framework. Critics argue that the Seven Mountain Mandate is a direct challenge to democratic values and religious pluralism, with some believing it aims to foster Christian supremacy.\n\nCunningham\u0027s early connections to charismatic and Pentecostal movements, including his support of William Branham and his involvement in the Latter Rain movement, are discussed in detail.

      "description": "Support the show:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/branham\n\nAvailable on Spotify, Google, and Apple Podcasts:\nhttps://william-branham.org/podcast\n\nJohn and Steve examine the complex historical and theological underpinnings of the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) and its ties to earlier religious movements, particularly Christian Identity and the Latter Rain. The hosts discuss the emerging doctrinal themes of the NAR, such as dominion theology and end-time prophecies, questioning their alignment with traditional Christian beliefs. They highlight disturbing elements within the NAR, such as the militarization of theology and the conflation of Christian and non-Christian spiritual ideas, warning that these trends may lead to a false kingdom with a false Christ. The conversation reflects on how the NAR borrows from both New Age and Gnostic teachings, with figures like Jane Leade and Alice Bailey being cited for their influence on modern religious movements.\n\nAs the hosts explore these connections, they focus on the alarming parallels between the NAR and occult beliefs. They discuss figures like\u00A0Aleister Crowley and his influence on religious thinking, and how some NAR leaders are adopting practices and ideologies that align with esoteric and Luciferian thought. The episode also reflects on how deceptive teachings can slowly erode the line between good and evil, leading believers into dangerous territory. By tracing the theological roots and contemporary manifestations of these movements, the hosts provide a critical analysis that seeks to expose their underlying dangers, particularly for Christians who may unknowingly be led astray by these teachings.",

      "description": "More information:\nhttps://william-branham.org/site/research/people/ern_baxter\n\n Ern Baxter was pivotal in the Pentecostal, Latter Rain, and Charismatic movements. Baxter\u2019s work as a campaign manager and Bible teacher for William Branham shaped many doctrines, particularly in the controversial Shepherding movement, which emphasized authoritarian leadership. The movement\u2019s control over its followers, paired with psychological and spiritual abuse, is highlighted as a destructive force, leaving a lasting influence on the authoritarian structures within the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR). Baxter\u2019s life is traced from his early ministry beginnings in 1932, through his leadership in the Evangelistic Tabernacle of Vancouver, to his collaboration with William Branham during the Latter Rain revival. His involvement in promoting Branham\u2019s alleged angelic visitations and the healing campaigns further entrenched his influence across the Charismatic movement.\n\nThe narrative also covers the eventual fallout between Baxter and Branham, focusing on the doctrinal rifts, particularly over Branham\u2019s serpent seed doctrine, which had connections to white supremacist ideologies. Baxter distanced himself from Branham after realizing the harmful effects of Branham\u2019s teachings. However, his departure was met with attempts to discredit his character, including accusations of misconduct and immoral behavior. The legacy of these movements, the abuses, and the doctrinal controversies are laid out as pivotal moments that shaped the direction of the Charismatic movement and its authoritarian structures.\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:15 Ern Baxter\u2019s Role in the Revival Movements\n01:43 Baxter\u2019s Early Ministry and Pentecostal Roots\n03:02 The Evangelistic Tabernacle and Baxter\u2019s Leadership\n04:15 Collaboration with William Branham\n05:29 The Healing Revivals and Branham\u2019s Miracles\n07:00 Doctrinal Controversies and the Serpent Seed Teaching\n08:21 Baxter\u2019s Exit from Branham\u2019s Campaign and the Aftermath\n\n______________________\n\u2013 Support the channel: https://www.patreon.com/branham\n\u2013 Subscribe to the channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBSpezVG15TVG-lOYMRXuyQ\n\u2013 Visit the website: https://william-branham.org\n\u2013 Follow on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WilliamBranhamOrg \n\u2013 Follow on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@william.m.branham\n\u2013 Follow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/wmbhr\n\u2013 Buy the books: https://william-branham.org/site/books",

His evangelical career began in the late 1940s, during the height of the Latter Rain movement, and he maintained strong connections with key figures like William Branham, despite the Assemblies of God denouncing the movement as heretical. Rodgers\u0027s ministry expanded rapidly, and he became known for hosting major revival events featuring influential figures from the Latter Rain and Charismatic movements. His Evangel Tabernacle in Owensboro, Kentucky, became a focal point for these movements, attracting notable names like Pat Robertson and Colonel Harland Sanders.\n\nDespite his success, Rodgers\u0027s ministry was marred by controversy, particularly legal battles involving financial misconduct. One of the most significant cases involved a lawsuit filed by Betty Lee Cox, who accused Evangel Tabernacle of fraudulent bond sales for a church construction project. Later, Rodgers\u0027s son, Bob Rodgers, continued his father\u0027s legacy but became embroiled in further controversies, including allegations of financial mismanagement related to a trust fund and involvement in the New Apostolic Reformation\u0027s political agenda. Bob Rodgers gained notoriety for his fiery sermons, particularly those claiming the 2020 U.S. Presidential election was stolen, where he invoked curses upon those he believed were responsible.\n\n00:00 Introduction  \n00:15 Early Life and Conversion  \n01:06 Evangelical Career and Latter Rain Connections  \n02:56 Growth of Evangel Tabernacle  \n03:54 Legal Controversies and Financial Misconduct  \n05:30 Legacy and Bob Rodgers\u2019s Controversial Ministry\n______________________\n\u2013 Support the channel: https://www.patreon.com/branham\n\u2013 Subscribe to the channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBSpezVG15TVG-lOYMRXuyQ\n\u2013 Visit the website: https://william-branham.org\n\u2013 Follow on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WilliamBranhamOrg \n\u2013 Follow on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@william.m.branham\n\u2013 Follow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/wmbhr\n\u2013 Buy the books: https://william-branham.org/site/books",

The discussion then delves into the misinterpretation of Genesis 1:28 by NAR leaders, who claim that Christians should dominate these societal mountains, which critics argue is a flawed exegesis.\n\nThe narrative progresses by tracing the NAR\u0027s theological lineage to Christian Identity, particularly through figures like Wesley Swift, who propagated anti-Semitic and anti-Catholic views under the guise of Christian doctrine. These ideas were later absorbed and repackaged by leaders like William Branham, influencing the development of the NAR\u0027s theology.

      "description": "Cyrus Ingerson Scofield is a controversial figure in American Christianity, primarily known for his Scofield Reference Bible published in 1909. This Bible, with its dispensationalist notes, had a profound impact on Evangelical and fundamentalist Christianity. Scofield\u0027s study notes provided a structured, literal interpretation of the Bible, emphasizing prophecy and the end times. His influence extended beyond his lifetime, deeply embedding dispensationalism in movements such as fundamentalism, Pentecostalism, the Latter Rain movement, and the New Apostolic Reformation. \n\nScofield\u0027s early career was marked by political and legal scandals. As a probate attorney in Kansas, he engaged in various fraudulent activities, leading to his resignation from federal office and subsequent arrest for forgery. While serving time, Scofield claimed a dramatic conversion to Evangelical Christianity, entering the ministry and rising to prominence. His association with Dwight Moody and mentorship under James Brooks solidified his theological foundation. The Scofield Reference Bible, particularly its dispensationalist framework, became a cornerstone for Christian fundamentalism and Pentecostalism, influencing their teachings and eschatological views.\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:16 The Impact of the Scofield Reference Bible\n01:00 Scofield\u0027s Dispensationalism and Influence\n02:00 Early Political Career and Scandals\n04:20 Conversion and Rise in Evangelical Christianity\n05:00 Theological Foundation and Associations\n05:27 Influence on Fundamentalism and Pentecostalism\n06:50 Role in the Latter Rain Movement\n08:07 Scofield\u0027s Influence on the New Apostolic Reformation \n\n______________________\n\u2013 Support the channel: https://www.patreon.com/branham\n\u2013 Subscribe to the channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBSpezVG15TVG-lOYMRXuyQ\n\u2013 Visit the website: https://william-branham.org\n\u2013 Follow on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WilliamBranhamOrg \n\u2013 Follow on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@william.m.branham\n\u2013 Follow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/wmbhr\n\u2013 Buy the books: https://william-branham.org/site/books",

They critically examine the bizarre and harmful doctrines propagated by these Latter Rain / NAR movements, such as the notion that true Christians are identifiable by their adherence to specific cult practices, like dress codes or loyalty to particular leaders. This elitist ideology creates a sense of spiritual arrogance and judgmental attitudes among followers, leading to a closed-off, insular community. The hosts also discuss the historical roots of these beliefs, tracing back to the early Pentecostal and Latter Rain revivals, and how these ideas have evolved and persisted over time. By analyzing sermons and teachings from various leaders within the movement, John and James reveal the contradictions and manipulations used to maintain control over members, ultimately calling for a return to a more inclusive and biblically sound understanding of Christianity.",

      "description": "More information and references:\nhttps://william-branham.org/site/research/people/bob_jones\n\nBob Jones and William Branham are influential yet controversial figures within the charismatic movement, each having a significant impact on its development. Jones was known for his alleged prophetic visions, dreams, and involvement with the Kansas City Prophets and the International House of Prayer (IHOP) in Kansas City. His ministry was marked by claims of supernatural experiences and guiding the future of the New Apostolic Reformation. Similarly, Branham, revered as a powerful prophet in American history, had a ministry filled with detailed prophecies, many of which were believed to be accurate by his followers. Both men shared histories of claimed supernatural experiences and struggles with mental health, which they described as encounters with the divine.\n\nThe transcript delves into the controversial nature of their ministries, highlighting allegations of misconduct, false prophecies, and connections to occult practices. Jones\u0027 influence on Mike Bickle and the Kansas City Fellowship is evident as he convinced Bickle of grand prophetic visions and a new order of Christianity. Branham\u0027s legacy in the Latter Rain movement and his connections to questionable figures like the Ku Klux Klan are explored, showing how his doctrines influenced subsequent charismatic leaders. The blending of metaphysical beliefs with Christian teachings and the perpetuation of failed prophecies by both Jones and Branham underscore the contentious aspects of their ministries.\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:15 Mike Bickle Praising William Branham\n01:00 Bob Jones and the Kansas City Prophets\n01:46 Bob Jones\u0027 Alleged Sinful Past and Parallels to Branham\n02:35 Leadership Issues and Ignored Misconduct\n03:00 Sexual Misconduct Allegations in Bickle\u0027s Ministry\n03:54 Bob Jones\u0027 Influence on Mike Bickle\n04:52 Jones\u0027 Alleged Visions and New Order of Christianity\n05:37 Controversies and Occult Practices\n06:30 Jones\u0027 Energy Transference Beliefs\n07:00 Failed Prophecies and the Stock Market Crash\n07:50 Recreating Branham\u0027s Ministry and Stage Persona\n08:25 Branham\u0027s Revival History and Controversial Associations\n09:00 The Angel \u0022Emma\u0022 and Revival Influences\n09:50 Manifest Sons of God Doctrine and End Times Army\n10:20 References\n\n______________________\n\u2013 Support the channel: https://www.patreon.com/branham\n\u2013 Subscribe to the channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBSpezVG15TVG-lOYMRXuyQ\n\u2013 Visit the website: https://william-branham.org\n\u2013 Follow on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WilliamBranhamOrg \n\u2013 Follow on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@william.m.branham\n\u2013 Follow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/wmbhr\n\u2013 Buy the books: https://william-branham.org/site/books",

We examine how early influences, particularly from figures like William Branham and Jane Lead, have shaped modern teachings in these movements. They delve into the blending of Christian and New Age ideas, particularly focusing on concepts like the Manifest Sons of God, eschatological perfection, and the so-called sacred purge. The episode highlights the significant overlaps between New Age beliefs and the teachings of the NAR, suggesting a convergence of these streams of thought over time.\n\n\nJohn and Steve emphasize the dangers of these converging apostate teachings, particularly how they manipulate biblical texts to promote elitist and often harmful ideologies. The discussion also touches on the historical contexts that have allowed these ideas to proliferate, including the influence of Christian Identity teachings and their racist underpinnings. By tracing the development of these movements and their shared themes, the hosts aim to shed light on the complex web of doctrines that have influenced modern Pentecostal and charismatic movements, urging listeners to critically examine these teachings in light of their historical and ideological origins.\n\n\nThe Converging Apostasy:\nhttps://a.co/d/5zZiRRW",

      "description": "Resources and additional information:\nhttps://william-branham.org/site/research/people/kenneth_copeland\n\nKenneth Copeland is a prominent American televangelist and founder of Kenneth Copeland Ministries, known for its emphasis on Prosperity theology. This doctrine teaches that faith, positive speech, and donations can lead to financial and physical blessings. Copeland\u0027s ministry has a global reach through television, radio broadcasts, books, and international crusades. He has built significant political ties, notably supporting former President Donald Trump and serving on Trump\u0027s Evangelical Executive Advisory Board. Copeland\u0027s wealth and influence are substantial, with a headquarters featuring an extensive campus, a private airstrip, and luxury properties. His personal lifestyle, including owning multiple private jets, has drawn scrutiny and criticism, yet his teachings continue to attract a large following.\n\nCopeland\u0027s rise in the evangelical world is closely tied to the Latter Rain movement of the late 1940s, which emphasized the restoration of apostolic gifts such as healing and prophecy. Influenced by figures like William Branham and Oral Roberts, Copeland incorporated elements of the Latter Rain movement into his ministry. His teachings on prosperity and the power of spoken words to manifest physical and financial realities are foundational to the Word of Faith movement. Copeland\u0027s message of prosperity theology has faced significant criticism for its perceived exploitation of vulnerable believers, yet the movement continues to grow with Copeland at the forefront, leveraging his extensive media platform to reach a global audience.\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:16 Overview of Kenneth Copeland\u0027s Ministry \n01:43 Influence of the Latter Rain Movement\n03:08 Connection with Oral Roberts\n03:46 Influence of William Branham\u0027s Teachings\n04:00 Influence of the Word of Faith Movement\n04:26 Influence of William Branham\u0027s Deity Cult\n05:12 Prosperity Gospel and Positive Confession\n05:50 Influence of John Alexander Dowie\n06:58 Criticism of Prosperity Theology\n07:41 Influence on the New Apostolic Reformation \n______________________\n\u2013 Support the channel: https://www.patreon.com/branham\n\u2013 Subscribe to the channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBSpezVG15TVG-lOYMRXuyQ\n\u2013 Visit the website: https://william-branham.org\n\u2013 Follow on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WilliamBranhamOrg \n\u2013 Follow on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@william.m.branham\n\u2013 Follow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/wmbhr\n\u2013 Buy the books: https://william-branham.org/site/books",

      "description": "The networking strategy of key figures in the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) has significantly contributed to the movement\u0027s growth and internal strength. This strategy allowed independent charismatic ministries to support one another while functioning autonomously. Critics outside the NAR express concern over the perceived abandonment of sound theology and the spread of false doctrines, as leaders with limited theological understanding introduce extra-biblical themes. The NAR aims to create an Endtime Revival to claim dominion over various Christian denominations and non-Christians, focusing on pop culture and democratic individualism. The movement\u0027s networking strategy involves re-evaluating past Christian practices to bring about a global revival, essentially rewriting the DNA of Christianity.\n\nThe NAR\u0027s development into a social movement can be traced back to the Social Gospel, which merged church and politics to address social issues. Figures like Charles Oliver Brown and Washington Gladden laid the groundwork for this movement, with Baptist theologian Walter Rauschenbusch furthering its theological framework. C. Peter Wagner, a key figure in the NAR, built upon the Social Gospel concepts, introducing the idea of engaging in spiritual warfare against demonic forces. Wagner\u0027s portrayal of the NAR as a militant band of spiritual warriors has led to controversy and violence, as members adopt an insiders versus outsiders mentality. The NAR\u0027s objective to claim dominion over societal spheres involves establishing a strongly networked presence within them, although this has raised concerns about the movement\u0027s influence on political and social changes.\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:17 Networking Strategy and Growth \n02:56 Historical Context of Social Gospel\n04:47 Influence of Henry George and Social Reform \n06:51 C.

Jesse shares his story of growing up in a family that was initially not very religious, but gradually became more involved in church activities. He experienced a significant spiritual event at the age of 15, which led him to have a vision about confronting the Pope. This vision marked the beginning of Jesse\u0027s deep spiritual journey, leading him to various religious experiences, including speaking in tongues.\n\nAs Jesse\u0027s journey continues, he describes how he got involved in different denominations and eventually came across the teachings of William Branham. Jesse was drawn to Branham\u0027s emphasis on healings and spiritual experiences, which led him to leave his previous church and Bible school. He then delves into his deeper involvement with other movements and teachings, including those of Bill Britton and the sonship movement. Over time, Jesse became more isolated in his beliefs, leading to conflicts with mainstream denominations and eventually joining a church in the NAR network. Jesse\u0027s story highlights the dangers of spiritual deception and the importance of seeking the truth with a humble heart.",

      "description": "Recently, Perry Stone resurrected a so-called \u0022vision\u0022 that William Branham claimed to have been fulfilled in the 1960s. Considering the complex relationship between Evangelical Christianity, particularly within the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR), and past failed prophecies concerning the 2020 election, this is shaping up to be a battle of the \u0022prophets.\u0022\n\nEvangelical leaders in the NAR have made numerous prophecies about political outcomes, positioning Trump as a defender of Christian values despite his controversial personal conduct. His policies resonate with these groups, who see his re-election as a means to validate their prophetic claims after his loss in 2020. In contrast, Harris is portrayed negatively, her progressive stances seen as antithetical to Evangelical beliefs, marking her potential victory as a spiritual defeat. \n\nThis video examines the origins of prophetic political involvement within Evangelical circles regarding presidential campaigns, tracing back to the 1944 election and the influence of figures like Roy E. Davis and Gerald Burton Winrod. These early leaders used their platforms to merge Christian fundamentalism with political agendas, laying the groundwork for future prophetic claims. William Branham\u2019s evolving prophecies, including a controversial vision of a female president, exemplify the fluid nature of these predictions, which are often retrofitted to suit current political climates. This pattern underscores the strategic use of prophecy in shaping political allegiances within the Evangelical community.\n\nChapters:\n00:00 Introduction\n00:16 Trump vs. Harris in the Evangelical Community\n03:29 1940 Christian Identity and the re-election of Franklin D.

They discuss the pattern of abuse and the exploitation of followers within various religious movements, noting how leaders like Freeman manipulated their congregations, resulting in significant harm and legal scrutiny. They highlight instances where followers, indoctrinated with the belief of spiritual healing, suffered severe consequences, including death, due to the rejection of medical treatment. The podcast also addresses the broader issue of how religious leaders control information to maintain their influence over their followers.\n\nThe conversation emphasizes the difficulty ex-cult members face in adjusting to life outside the cult. Many struggle with residual indoctrination and find it challenging to reconcile their beliefs with new, healthier religious environments. The hosts stress the importance of therapy and proper guidance for those recovering from such experiences. They also discuss the legislative changes that occurred in response to the alarming death rates within these groups, showcasing the evolving legal landscape aimed at protecting vulnerable individuals from the harmful practices of exploitative religious leaders.",

      "description": "John Paul Jackson\u2019s journey in the realm of prophetic ministry began with a decade-long focus on the gospels and the book of Acts. A turning point came when he was influenced by a prophecy related to Romans chapter 4, which he read daily for three years. Jackson, a significant figure within the charismatic movement, is known for his work on dreams and biblical interpretations. His ministry was marked by his time with the Kansas City prophets, a group known for its controversial practices and doctrines. Despite facing criticism for his failed predictions, Jackson\u2019s influence persisted, and he became a crucial figure in the formation of IHOP-KC and the New Apostolic Reformation.\n\nReferences here:\nhttps://william-branham.org/site/research/people/john_paul_jackson\n______________________\n\u2013 Support the channel: https://www.patreon.com/branham\n\u2013 Subscribe to the channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBSpezVG15TVG-lOYMRXuyQ\n\u2013 Visit the website: https://william-branham.org\n\u2013 Follow on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WilliamBranhamOrg \n\u2013 Follow on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@william.m.branham\n\u2013 Follow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/wmbhr\n\u2013 Buy the books: https://william-branham.org/site/books",

      "description": "Weaponized Religion: From Christian Identity to the NAR:\nhttps://william-branham.org/site/books/weaponized_religion_from_christian_identity_to_the_nar\n \nThe NAR has a relatively unexplored link to very dangerous conspiracy theories. One such theory is the so-called \u0022Serpent DNA.\u0022  We examine Matthew Taylor Coleman, who was convinced that his children inherited serpent DNA. Coleman murdered them in a bid to prevent their transformation into reptilians. Anthony Quinn Warner, similarly influenced, detonated an RV in Nashville, driven by a fear of an impending takeover by \u201Clizard people.\u201D These events underscore the dangerous impact of conspiracy theories on individuals and their actions. Yet this strange conspiracy has ties to NAR history.\n\nIt is imperative that we examine the infiltration of these conspiracy theories into segments of Evangelical Christianity, with the serpent DNA theory being just one notable example. The origins of this and other related doctrines can be identified by exploring how British Israelism evolved into Christian Identity through figures like Russell Kelso Carter and the adoption of the two-seed doctrine. The influence of these doctrines extended into the latter rain movement and was prominently featured in the teachings of leaders such as William Branham.  \n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:17 Coleman\u2019s Confession and Serpent DNA Theory\n01:09 Warner\u2019s RV Explosion in Nashville\n01:59 QAnon and the Rise of Conspiracy Theories\n02:46 Evangelical Adoption of QAnon Theories\n03:50 British Israelism\u2019s Racial Evolution\n04:48 Russell Kelso Carter and the Two-Seed Doctrine\n06:04 The Tree of Knowledge and Original Sin\n07:03 Integration of Heretical Beliefs\n07:59 Daniel Parker and Predestination\n08:47 Merging of Doctrines and White Supremacy\n09:49 Christian Identity Movement and Anti-Semitism\n11:00 Spread of Doctrines by George Hawtin and William Branham\n12:06 William Branham\u2019s Influence on Healing Revivals\n13:01 Conclusion and Further Investigation into Azusa Street Revival\n\n______________________\n\u2013 Support the channel: https://www.patreon.com/branham\n\u2013 Subscribe to the channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBSpezVG15TVG-lOYMRXuyQ\n\u2013 Visit the website: https://william-branham.org\n\u2013 Follow on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WilliamBranhamOrg \n\u2013 Follow on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@william.m.branham\n\u2013 Follow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/wmbhr\n\u2013 Buy the books: https://william-branham.org/site/books",

Destiny shares her journey of growing up in a highly religious household while attending public school. This dual experience led her to question the strict religious doctrines she was raised with. Her father, a preacher, enforced rules that clashed with the norms of her public school environment, creating internal conflict. Destiny describes her unique upbringing, characterized by frequent disagreements with her father over dress codes and other religious mandates. Her mother, though supportive, also faced the challenge of navigating these strict expectations. Despite the constraints, Destiny excelled academically and planned to use education as her path to independence.\n\nAs she matured, Destiny\u0027s critical thinking grew stronger, leading her to question the exclusivity and rigid practices of the Message. Her father\u0027s severe accident and subsequent need for intensive care became a pivotal moment, causing a shift in family dynamics and religious practices. Destiny reflects on the superficial nature of religious appearances within the Message and the importance of developing personal strength and a clear exit strategy for those wishing to leave similar environments. She emphasizes the value of education and independent thought, offering encouragement to others in similar situations to find their path and hold onto their convictions.",

Networks of ministries led by apostles and prophets, who claim to receive extra-biblical revelations from God for new doctrines, began to intersect. Each intersection point spawned a new NAR network to further develop and add to those doctrines. By January 1997, groups focused on the concept of \u0022spiritual warfare\u0022 had grown so large that they were reorganized as the United States Spiritual Warfare Prayer Network (USSPN).

As leaders of a group convinced they are engaged in spiritual warfare within a vivid realm of angels and demons, these authoritarian figures assume the role of \u0027generals\u0027 in an army. The rank-and-file members, serving merely as privates, are enlisted in a battle they do not fully comprehend.\n\nThe concept is widely promoted in the series titled \u201CGod\u2019s Generals,\u201D which, to the NAR, has become akin to the Books of Kings from the Old Testament. In these works, author Roberts Liardon chronicles the lineage of pivotal figures in the NAR\u0027s formation, dubbing some of the most influential among them as \u0022generals.\u0022 This viewpoint suggests that, historically, the Holy Spirit has opted to guide Christians through individual leaders rather than directly through the believers\u0027 hearts, in opposition to New Testament teachings such as Romans 5:5.\n______________________\n\u2013 Support the channel: https://www.patreon.com/branham\n\u2013 Subscribe to the channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBSpezVG15TVG-lOYMRXuyQ\n\u2013 Visit the website: https://william-branham.org\n\u2013 Follow on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WilliamBranhamOrg \n\u2013 Follow on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@william.m.branham\n\u2013 Follow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/wmbhr\n\u2013 Buy the books: https://william-branham.org/site/books",

Among those mentioned were Todd Bentley, Mike Bickle, Jon Crowder, Rick Joyner, and others. Rather than abandon the destructive theology, the group continued to recruit for the so-called army, and new \u0022generals\u0022 were appointed to lead. How did this army form? What is their mission? To find out, we must explore the origins of the Manifested Sons of God.\n\nSPLC:\nhttps://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2008/todd-bentley%E2%80%99s-militant-joel%E2%80%99s-army-gains-followers-florida\n______________________\n\u2013 Support the channel: https://www.patreon.com/branham\n\u2013 Subscribe to the channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBSpezVG15TVG-lOYMRXuyQ\n\u2013 Visit the website: https://william-branham.org\n\u2013 Follow on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WilliamBranhamOrg \n\u2013 Follow on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@william.m.branham\n\u2013 Follow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/wmbhr\n\u2013 Buy the books: https://william-branham.org/site/books",

      "description": "Weaponized Religion: From Christian Identity to the NAR:\nhttps://william-branham.org/site/books/weaponized_religion_from_christian_identity_to_the_nar\n\nThe video explores the influential rise of the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR), an Evangelical Christian movement aiming to assert dominion over key societal domains, including politics, business, and culture. It discusses the movement\u0027s leaders who view themselves as divinely appointed Apostles and Prophets preparing for Jesus Christ\u0027s return. The narrative delves into the origins and key figures of the movement, such as C. Peter Wagner, and highlights the controversial practices and ideologies, including \u0027spiritual warfare\u0027 to control societal structures. Additionally, it covers the \u0022Seven Mountain Mandate,\u0022 which is the strategy to infiltrate and dominate sectors like business to fund their religious campaign.\n\nThe content also examines the movement\u0027s connections to historical and controversial theological trends like British Israelism, and discusses influential figures like A.B. Simpson, whose teachings impacted the Pentecostal and Charismatic movements. The video contrasts early Christian practices with the NAR\u0027s modern strategies, particularly their focus on accumulating wealth to fund their vision of a global Christian governance. It critically analyzes the shift in missionary work from spiritual service to strategic financial operations, reflecting on how these changes align with or deviate from traditional Christian values.\n\n______________________\n\u2013 Support the channel: https://www.patreon.com/branham\n\u2013 Subscribe to the channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBSpezVG15TVG-lOYMRXuyQ\n\u2013 Visit the website: https://william-branham.org\n\u2013 Follow on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WilliamBranhamOrg \n\u2013 Follow on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@william.m.branham\n\u2013 Follow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/wmbhr\n\u2013 Buy the books: https://william-branham.org/site/books\n\nYouTube Chapters:\n0:00 - Introduction to the New Apostolic Reformation\n0:17 - Terry Gross\u0027s NPR Expose on NAR\u0027s Influence\n0:33 - Ideological Foundations and Dominion Theology\n1:04 - Understanding the \u0022Seven Mountain Mandate\u0022\n1:43 - Controversial Tactics: Spiritual Warfare for Societal Control\n2:00 - The Business Mountain: Funding Religious Dominance\n3:01 - Comparisons with Early Christian Missionary Practices\n3:25 - A.B.

      "description": "Weaponized Religion: From Christian Identity to the NAR:\nhttps://william-branham.org/site/books/weaponized_religion_from_christian_identity_to_the_nar\n\nThe episode delves into the deep-seated roots and development of Christian nationalism in the United States, particularly focusing on figures like Gerald L.K. Smith and the movement\u2019s ties to white supremacy. Smith, a Christian nationalist and minister, was known for his efforts to preserve America as a Christian nation, using platforms like his publication \u0022The Cross and the Flag\u0022 to spread his ideology. The narrative tracks the historical backdrop of Smith\u0027s activism against a broader canvas of racial and religious prejudices, tracing it back to early American history and European colonial mandates, which justified conquest and subjugation in the name of Christianity.\n\nThe discussion spans from the inception of Christian nationalism in the 15th century with the papal decrees that led to the oppression of non-Christians, through the racial and religious conflicts in post-Civil War America, to the 19th-century spread of British Israelism. This doctrine posited that Western Europeans and their descendants were the true heirs of biblical promises. Influential figures like Professor C. Totten of Yale promoted these views, intertwining them with American nationalism and militarism. The video explores how these religious and racial ideologies were propagated through political movements and religious teachings, ultimately influencing major social and political developments in American history.\n\n______________________\n\u2013 Support the channel: https://www.patreon.com/branham\n\u2013 Subscribe to the channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBSpezVG15TVG-lOYMRXuyQ\n\u2013 Visit the website: https://william-branham.org\n\u2013 Follow on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WilliamBranhamOrg \n\u2013 Follow on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@william.m.branham\n\u2013 Follow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/wmbhr\n\u2013 Buy the books: https://william-branham.org/site/books\n\nChapters:\n0:00 - Introduction to Christian Nationalism\n0:17 - Gerald L.K.
