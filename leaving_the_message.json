      "description": "@ComicNewsCorp \n\nA humorous, satirical take on the intersection of politics and prophecy, specifically focusing on how candidates leverage divine intervention as a campaign strategy. It presents the concept of \u201CProphecy Politics,\u201D where politicians claim divine support to bypass traditional campaign elements like debates, voter outreach, or even polling. The narrative touches on how candidates, with the help of the New Apostolic Reformation (N.A.R.), declare themselves divinely destined to win, and when they lose, reinterpret the result as part of a larger, divine plan. This framework allows them to maintain legitimacy regardless of the outcome, often framing setbacks as \u201CGod\u2019s will\u201D redirecting them toward a greater purpose.\n\nThe satire further explores how prophecy becomes a flexible tool for any political situation. Politicians can claim miracles to delay results or divine recounts if the numbers don\u2019t add up in their favor. The introduction of personal prophets at rallies and even pre-recorded prophecies ensures that the message can be tailored to any audience and victory claimed as divine intervention, making traditional campaign strategies seem obsolete. Ultimately, it critiques the blending of religious prophecy with political ambition in a whimsical yet biting fashion.\n______________________\n\u2013 Support the channel: https://www.patreon.com/branham\n\u2013 Subscribe to the channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBSpezVG15TVG-lOYMRXuyQ\n\u2013 Visit the website: https://william-branham.org\n\u2013 Follow on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WilliamBranhamOrg \n\u2013 Follow on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@william.m.branham\n\u2013 Follow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/wmbhr\n\u2013 Buy the books: https://william-branham.org/site/books",

The discussion focuses on the emotional and spiritual damage caused by William Branham\u2019s teachings. Gay shares how her father became involved with the cult and how the environment was marked by anger, fear, and confusion. They recall how Branham\u2019s manipulation tactics, such as rigging faith healing events, deceived people into believing in his divine powers. The conversation touches on the pain experienced by women in the cult, especially when Branham compared them to animals, which led Gay to struggle with her self-worth for many years. John adds his own experiences growing up in the cult and notes how Branham\u2019s followers were indoctrinated with teachings that had little to do with the true message of Christianity. \n\nAs they continue, the pair explore the financial corruption within the organization, discussing how donations were funneled into the Jehovah-Jireh Foundation, enriching Branham\u2019s family while keeping followers in ignorance. John highlights the repeated failures of Branham\u2019s doomsday prophecies, particularly the prediction of the rapture in 1977, which left followers disillusioned. Gay credits her mother for realizing early on that the cult was a harmful environment and taking steps to protect part of the family. Both John and Gay express deep gratitude for the research and revelations that have helped them leave the cult and restore their faith in Christianity. They conclude by encouraging listeners who are still trapped in the cult to seek the truth and find freedom from the lies.",

They explore the contrast between their personal, behind-the-scenes experiences with various religious leaders and the public personas these figures present. The dialogue touches on themes like manipulation within religious organizations, the cult-like dynamics of groups like Kansas City Fellowship (KCF), and how leaders manipulate their followers. They reflect on how people are often kept in a state of urgency and fear, convinced that they are part of a special, end-time movement. \n\nAs the discussion progresses, they also delve into the human side of these religious figures, showing that many leaders are deeply flawed and can engage in behavior they know to be wrong while believing it serves a higher purpose. This exploration leads to a broader analysis of religious movements\u2019 tendency to exploit their members, whether knowingly or unknowingly, for financial or reputational gain. The conversation also hints at the difficulties in escaping the cycle of manipulation and control, as former members often remain psychologically tied to the same systems they left.",

They discuss the various psychological and organizational manipulations used by cults, particularly their own experiences in the William Branham movement. A significant portion of the episode focuses on the cult\u0027s tactics such as behavioral control, thought manipulation, and the use of authoritarian leadership. The hosts reflect on their experiences of leaving the cult and how mind control techniques like positive confession and the demonization of critical thinking were employed to keep members compliant. These techniques often left followers isolated, believing there was no valid reason to leave, and convinced that questioning the cult was equivalent to committing an unforgivable sin.\n\nThe discussion expands to the influence of the Latter Rain and New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) movements, linking their structures to authoritarianism and destructive tendencies. There is a critical examination of the damage these movements have caused through spiritual abuse and how they warp the gospel to serve the leaders\u0027 agendas. Throughout the episode, Collins and Paisley share personal anecdotes and broader examples of how good people in these environments are manipulated into performing harmful actions under the guise of divine authority. They stress the importance of recognizing the signs of destructive cults and the difficulty for members to escape due to the deep psychological control exerted over them.",

They explore the rise of Kenzie within the Faith Assembly, his eventual disillusionment, and his departure from the group. The conversation touches on the dangers of unchecked leadership within religious movements, highlighting the personal and doctrinal conflicts that arise when authority is concentrated in a single figure like Hobart Freeman. The speakers emphasize the importance of independent thought and the dangers of blind obedience in religious settings, particularly in groups that discourage questioning or external influences.\n\n\nThe dialogue also sheds light on the challenges faced by those who leave such groups, both emotionally and socially. Kenzie\u2019s journey from being a highly regarded minister to leaving and facing ostracism is detailed, reflecting the broader issues of control and manipulation within cult-like religious movements. The discussion underscores the need for accountability and the courage to challenge harmful doctrines and practices within religious communities.",

The discussion traces how IHOP KC\u0027s formation is rooted in a series of prophetic histories and movements, drawing strong parallels between it and earlier movements like the Latter Rain. The conversation exposes questionable narratives regarding Bickle\u0027s personal story and the prophetic figures around him, particularly the messianic claims tied to Mike\u2019s brother, Pat Bickle, who was prophesied to be healed but passed away. Despite these failed prophecies, the organization persisted, continuously reshaping its history and vision.\n\nThe dialogue also raises critical questions about the influence of real estate, finance, and the structural organization of IHOP KC, including its connection to the Kansas City Prophets. The influence of various charismatic leaders, the manipulation of prophetic histories, and the complexities of public perception versus internal realities are explored. The discussion points to potential manipulation in how the movement evolved and spread, using various tactics such as altering public records and encouraging testimonies as a distraction from failures in prophecy or internal controversy.",

Pascal shares insights into her background, growing up in a multicultural setting in Mali, and later transitioning to involvement in YWAM, highlighting the influence of both her family and Christian networks. She reflects on her time with YWAM, sharing both positive and critical views on its mission work and doctrinal impact. Pascal emphasizes how teachings in YWAM, tied to movements such as the NAR (New Apostolic Reformation), shaped her approach to Christian missions and worldview, particularly in relation to the concept of Dominionism.\n\nAs the conversation continues, Pascal touches on the challenges he faced after joining YWAM, including the physical and emotional toll of missionary work. She explains how her education at prestigious boarding schools didn\u0027t shield him from the lure of mission work, and how her involvement in YWAM eventually led to disillusionment. The interview delves into YWAM\u0027s global network, its decentralized structure, and the lasting influence of its founder, Loren Cunningham. Pascal and John also explore YWAM\u2019s connection to broader Christian networks and movements like IHOP (International House of Prayer) and Bethel Church, discussing how these ties fostered the growth of modern charismatic movements.",

It highlights Smith\u2019s early involvement with the Foursquare Church, his leadership of Calvary Chapel, and his influence on charismatic and evangelical Christian culture. Smith\u2019s relationship with figures like Paul Cain and Lonnie Frisbee is discussed in detail, emphasizing his connection to the Latter Rain movement and the New Apostolic Reformation. The transcript also touches upon his distancing from the extremes of charismatic Christianity, positioning Calvary Chapel in a more balanced but still spiritually open role.\n\nSmith\u2019s ministry intersected with notable events, such as his involvement with William Branham\u2019s prot\u00E9g\u00E9s, and his participation in the healing revivals. The narrative delves into the broader influence of figures like Paul Cain, David Berg, and Lonnie Frisbee, exploring their controversial practices, including spiritualism, occultism, and the emphasis on signs and wonders.

The conversation highlights how Freeman\u0027s authoritarian leadership contributed to the group\u2019s eventual downfall, with key ministers and followers increasingly recognizing flaws in the cult\u0027s practices. The psychological aspects of cult leadership are explored, with Freeman\u0027s style aligning closely with traits of narcissistic personality disorder. The conversation provides insight into Freeman\u0027s approach to maintaining control, often invoking fear and divine threats to retain followers, while the leadership remained oblivious to the assembly\u0027s decreasing numbers and growing discontent.\n\n\nKey figures like Bruce Kenzie are introduced, offering a window into the internal dynamics of Faith Assembly. Kenzie\u2019s rise within the church, despite initial resistance from Freeman, shows how power and influence were carefully distributed. His eventual exit marks a critical turning point for the assembly, emphasizing how even those deeply embedded in the cult\u0027s leadership can break away. The complex relationships within the leadership and their strategic positions offer an intriguing look into how the assembly functioned and foreshadow its collapse.\n\n\nChino\u0027s YouTube Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@chinodross",

The discussion kicks off with an exploration of the complex history and the difficulties in separating truth from deception in these movements. The hosts, John Collins and Brantley Smith, emphasize the challenges of discerning individuals\u2019 intentions\u2014whether they were misguided, manipulated, or predators\u2014while also addressing their contributions to the movement. They offer insight into the cult-like behavior that pervades these organizations, particularly focusing on spiritual abuse and its correlation with more egregious misconduct.\n\nA key segment of the episode scrutinizes the roles of John Wimber, Mike Bickle, Paul Cain, and Bob Jones, discussing their influence on the charismatic movement and the controversial behaviors that were often shielded or overlooked. The episode highlights Wimber\u2019s role in addressing Bob Jones\u2019 abuse, illustrating Wimber\u2019s transparent and strict approach to discipline in comparison to other leaders. Ultimately, the podcast paints a picture of a religious landscape rife with abuse of power, secrecy, and the gray areas between genuine faith and manipulation.",

The discussion touches on the rigid, extreme beliefs of the group, particularly in terms of faith healing, rejecting education, and isolating members from the outside world. The guest shares personal stories about her family\u2019s life in the cult, including faith healing practices, restrictions on clothing, and the suppression of secular culture. Over time, her family experienced increasing legalism and control, culminating in a faith crisis when faith healing failed to help her brother\u2019s broken arm. The episode dives into the emotional and psychological toll of growing up in this isolated, oppressive environment, highlighting themes of fear, indoctrination, and eventual disillusionment with the cult.\n\nThe guest\u0027s story is one of resilience, as she eventually broke free from the cult\u0027s influence, pursued higher education, and built a life beyond the trauma of her childhood. She touches on the challenges of healing from such an upbringing, including the need for therapy and self-reflection, and how difficult it can be to establish healthy relationships and boundaries after growing up in a controlling religious environment. The conversation also delves into parallels between Faith Assembly and other similar religious movements, noting common tactics of indoctrination, fear-based control, and isolation from the outside world.",

They explore how figures like Wesley Swift and Gerald L. K. Smith shaped Christian identity, promoting doctrines of white supremacy and anti-Semitism that later merged with Pentecostalism and influenced movements like Latter Rain and the NAR. The discussion highlights the complex history of these figures, their influence on political and religious movements, and the consequences of their ideologies, which continue to impact certain Christian circles today.\n\nThe conversation also touches on the significant events and connections between various individuals and organizations that facilitated the spread of Christian identity.

Thanks to a hand-written letter from Graham Snelling, former pastor of the Branham Tabernacle, Branham\u0027s criminal tax fraud is exposed. The discussion highlights long-held rumors and unverified stories about Branham\u0027s connections to questionable activities, which have not been fully documented. The hosts carefully present an argument, noting that while they cannot definitively prove these allegations, the sheer number of witnesses involved lends some credibility to the claims. \n\nThe conversation expands on how Graham Snelling, after years of working with Branham, took over as pastor of the Tabernacle in the late 1940s. However, after a series of tumultuous events, Snelling resigned in 1951. His resignation letter reveals internal disputes, including allegations of mishandling church funds and Branham\u2019s tendency to force out other leaders. The episode underscores the complexity of Branham\u0027s operations and the conflicts between public perception and private realities, particularly regarding financial transparency and church leadership.",

His influence, especially within Pentecostal and charismatic movements, was substantial, yet his teachings were met with both support and criticism. Prince was notably involved with the Full Gospel Business Men\u0027s Fellowship International during the same time that William Branham\u0027s deity cult was forming. His teachings on spiritual warfare and deliverance from demonic influences became a central aspect of his ministry. Despite his popularity, many criticized his approach to deliverance, claiming it fostered fear and unhealthy spiritual paranoia.\n\nAfter Branham\u0027s death in 1965, Prince joined forces with Ern Baxter to form the controversial Shepherding Movement, which influenced the structure of many modern Pentecostal and charismatic networks, including the New Apostolic Reformation. His deep involvement in Christian Zionism and his collaboration with figures from the Christian Identity movement raised additional concerns. Despite these controversies, Prince\u0027s teachings on spiritual authority, the gifts of the Spirit, and deliverance have left a lasting legacy, shaping the theology of many Pentecostal and charismatic leaders across the globe.\n\n______________________\n\u2013 Support the channel: https://www.patreon.com/branham\n\u2013 Subscribe to the channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBSpezVG15TVG-lOYMRXuyQ\n\u2013 Visit the website: https://william-branham.org\n\u2013 Follow on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WilliamBranhamOrg \n\u2013 Follow on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@william.m.branham\n\u2013 Follow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/wmbhr\n\u2013 Buy the books: https://william-branham.org/site/books",

We dive into the intersections between William Branham\u0027s religious movement and its influence on other groups like the International House of Prayer (IHOP) and John Wimber\u0027s role in shaping modern charismatic movements. Cynthia shares her personal experiences as a musician playing for John Wimber\u0027s band, offering insight into Wimber\u2019s character and the cult of personality that developed around him. The conversation explores key themes such as indoctrination, manipulation of emotions in religious settings, and the blending of church and business models in evangelicalism. We also critically analyze how Wimber\u0027s theology influenced contemporary movements like the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR), pointing to dangerous deviations from traditional Christian teaching.\nAnother major point of discussion is the emotional manipulation tactics often seen in both cultic and charismatic movements. The speakers emphasize the importance of biblical literacy and historical theology in understanding these deviations, cautioning against following leaders who prioritize personal experience over scripture. Cynthia\u2019s anecdotes provide a first-hand perspective on the Vineyard movement\u2019s musical and spiritual practices, while the host, John Collins, links these observations to broader patterns of control and deception in modern Pentecostal and Charismatic movements, specifically within groups that emerged from the Latter Rain Revival.",

Jed Hartley, a former IHOP-KC member, shares his personal insights into the problematic histories behind the leadership of these movements. The conversation reveals patterns of abuse, manipulation, and exploitation that have shaped the operations of these religious groups, often stemming from the same roots as the Latter Rain movement. Both speakers highlight how these leaders repackage old heresies, like the Latter Rain, under new names to manipulate followers while concealing the darker aspects of their pasts.\n\n\nJohn Collins and Jed Hartley analyze how the figures within these movements, including prominent leaders like Bob Jones, Mike Bickle, and others, operate under the guise of prophetic authority. They describe how these figures have often engaged in fraudulent activities, using vague prophecies, selective testimonies, and outright deceit to exploit their followers. They also dive into how this system enables these leaders to protect each other from accountability, perpetuating an ongoing cycle of abuse and deception.

      "description": "Support the show:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/branham\n\n\nAvailable on Spotify, Google, and Apple Podcasts:\nhttps://william-branham.org/podcast\n\n\nThis discussion delves deeply into the shared history between two churches named \u0022Faith Assembly,\u0022 one founded by Hobart Freeman and the other rooted in William Branham\u0027s teachings. Although initially unconnected, parallels and shared doctrines emerge, notably from the Latter Rain Movement and influences from other charismatic leaders such as Gordon Lindsay and Kenneth Hagin. Both churches seem to share ideas around divine healing, manifestations of the sons of God, and prophetic ministry, though each group may deny a direct link. The conversation highlights the difficulty in tracing precise doctrinal origins but demonstrates that these movements borrowed heavily from each other, ultimately forming various sects with similar eschatological views.\n\n\nFurthermore, the speakers reflect on the nature of cult leadership and how teachings evolve over time. Hobart Freeman, for example, began by referencing many early charismatic figures favorably before eventually positioning himself as the sole holder of a complete end-time revelation. The dialogue touches on the need for critical examination of religious teachings and the dangers of unquestioned allegiance to a group or leader, particularly when past connections and shared ideas are unearthed.",

Lake. His experience in real estate and solar energy industries, along with his involvement in FGBMFI, gave him the network to organize conventions that featured prominent charismatic and Pentecostal figures. By the late 1990s, Pierce felt a strong spiritual calling that led him to reopen Lake\u2019s healing rooms in Spokane, Washington. He believed that through prayer at Lake\u2019s grave, he could absorb his spiritual anointing, and this practice, known as grave soaking, became central to his mission. Under Pierce\u2019s leadership, the healing rooms grew into a global network, promoting faith healing while whitewashing Lake\u0027s controversial past.\n\nDespite the movement\u2019s expansion, concerns about its ethical foundation persisted. John G. Lake\u0027s life was marred by financial scandals and unverified healing claims, raising skepticism about his authenticity as a spiritual leader. Yet, the modern revival of his ministry by Cal Pierce and others within the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) relied on a selective retelling of Lake\u2019s story. While many saw the healing rooms as a source of comfort, critics pointed out the dangers of perpetuating questionable practices in the name of revival. Pierce\u2019s work reinforced NAR\u2019s emphasis on supernatural experiences and grave soaking, contributing to a broader movement that often blurred the lines between faith and fraud.\n \n\n______________________\n\u2013 Support the channel: https://www.patreon.com/branham\n\u2013 Subscribe to the channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBSpezVG15TVG-lOYMRXuyQ\n\u2013 Visit the website: https://william-branham.org\n\u2013 Follow on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WilliamBranhamOrg \n\u2013 Follow on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@william.m.branham\n\u2013 Follow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/wmbhr\n\u2013 Buy the books: https://william-branham.org/site/books",

The speakers trace historical and modern examples of how pseudo-intellectualism, accelerationism, and spiritual warfare rhetoric have intertwined to create a dangerous and militant environment within certain religious groups. Drawing parallels between Christian identity movements, the occult, and figures like Steve Bannon and Alexander Dugin, the conversation reveals how political and religious figures have used apocalyptic language to stir unrest. This convergence is further explored through the lens of movements such as the Latter Rain and Christian identity, showing how these groups have influenced each other over time. \n\nA significant focus is on the dangers of weaponizing religion for political purposes. The conversation delves into historical moments where religious leaders incited violence or radical beliefs, such as in the Pentecostal and Latter Rain movements, which were linked to Christian identity extremism. The discussion ultimately points to a continued merging of religious extremism with far-right ideologies, raising concerns about how the NAR\u0027s language and teachings could potentially fuel future violence or societal collapse. The fear of apocalyptic outcomes, race wars, and radical militant actions is shown as a recurring theme in both past and present religious movements.",

Amy recounts her journey from a Baptist upbringing to becoming deeply involved in the message due to her father\u0027s influence. She describes the rigid rules and fear-based teachings that dominated her life, leading to severe anxiety and a sense of alienation from both the religious community and society at large. As Amy grew older, her critical thinking led her to question the doctrines she had been taught, particularly as she observed the contradictions and legalism within the movement. Her story illustrates the intense pressure and fear instilled in members, ultimately leading her to leave the message and seek a healthier spiritual path.\n\n\nThe discussion also touches on broader issues within cult-like religious movements, such as the suppression of critical thought and the manipulation of followers through fear. Both John and Amy share their personal experiences of gradually realizing the flaws and deceptions within the message. They emphasize the importance of seeking truth and maintaining a personal relationship with Jesus, independent of the legalistic structures imposed by such groups. The conversation serves as a powerful testimony to the challenges and rewards of breaking free from controlling religious systems.",

His teachings emphasized the \u0022naturally supernatural,\u0022 advocating for the incorporation of spiritual gifts into everyday life without theatrical displays. As a co-founder of the Vineyard Movement, Wimber\u0027s workshops attracted thousands, focusing on practical applications of ministry. However, his legacy, while celebrated by some, is contentious. His role in shaping Kingdom Now theology and connections to the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) have drawn criticism, particularly regarding the rewriting of his history by his followers and the influence of figures like C. Peter Wagner.\n\nWimber\u0027s association with questionable figures and movements such as William Branham, the Latter Rain, and later, the Kansas City Prophets, introduced problematic elements into charismatic Christianity. His promotion of these controversial figures, including Paul Cain, whose prophecies failed, tainted his legacy. Although he later distanced himself from certain aspects, critics argue that his earlier endorsements led to the continued rise of extremism in the NAR.

A significant theme is the manipulation and mind control tactics that leaders employ, which result in members disconnecting from critical thinking. These leaders are positioned as mediators between God and man, causing followers to unquestioningly accept their authority and teachings, even when faced with serious allegations of misconduct. The podcast touches on how these leaders are often restored to power despite their wrongdoings, leading to an unhealthy cycle of abuse and cover-up.\n\nAdam Short shares personal insights from his experience within Morningstar, providing a unique insider perspective on how these movements elevate leaders to near-divine status. The conversation also delves into the psychology of how followers are trained to seek \u0022nuggets\u0022 of divine truth within the chaotic and often nonsensical teachings of these leaders. As the discussion evolves, both John and Adam reflect on the broader implications for former members, who often wrestle with questions about their faith and salvation after leaving.

They highlight how deliverance ministries have adopted practices that mimic role-playing games, but with serious real-world consequences, manipulating vulnerable individuals into believing their illnesses or life challenges are caused by demons or curses. The transcript underscores the dangers of such practices, noting how they can lead to psychological harm, misplaced faith in unqualified individuals, and even loss of life.\n\nThe discussion also critiques the theology behind these movements, emphasizing the manipulative nature of their teachings. The transcript reveals the absurdity and dangers of the claims made by these Deliverance ministers, who often attribute physical and mental illnesses to spiritual causes, leading to harmful practices that can devastate individuals and families.

Martin reflects on how his radical conversion led him down a path of ministry despite eventual disillusionment with the charismatic movement\u0027s practices.

Both Martin and Collins critique the celebrity-like status ministers often hold and the pressure to maintain a flawless image, while behind the scenes, their personal lives may be falling apart. The discussion also highlights the challenges of leaving these religious movements and the healing process that follows, with many finding community and understanding outside of the charismatic world.",

Both John and Nate reflect on their upbringing in churches that, while providing positive community experiences, also propagated questionable theology and practices. They delve into the history of these movements, the blending of religion and politics, and the potential dangers of the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) and similar groups. The conversation also touches on the commercialization and politicization of Christianity, the misuse of scripture, and the rise of Christian nationalism. \n\n\nAs the discussion progresses, John and Nate express concerns about how these movements distort the message of Jesus and exploit religious beliefs for political agendas. They highlight the importance of returning to biblical teachings and avoiding the manipulation of scripture for personal or political gain. Both participants acknowledge the struggles of those who have left these movements, often feeling disillusioned or betrayed by their church experiences. The episode concludes with a call for a more authentic and scripturally grounded faith, free from the distortions and excesses that have come to characterize much of modern charismatic Christianity.",

The discussion centers on how Branham\u0027s rigid church order contrasted sharply with his condemnation of the Catholic Church\u0027s formalized worship. The irony lies in Branham\u0027s creation of equally, if not more, restrictive rules for his followers, which transformed the church environment into one of strict control and limited personal freedom in worship. \n\nAs Branham\u0027s influence grew, he introduced church order as a framework to regulate church governance and behavior, ostensibly to address excesses in charismatic worship. However, this framework also served to consolidate power, limiting the roles and influence of other ministers and prophets within the movement. The enforcement of these rules by deacons, who acted as enforcers directly under Branham\u0027s authority, led to an atmosphere of fear and strict adherence to conduct codes. This structure allowed Branham to maintain control over his followers and ensured that his version of worship and church governance prevailed, even after his death, shaping the practices of the message churches that followed. This appears to be the primary reason that leaders of the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) admit that Branham \u0022went astray.\u0022 \n\nCharles\u0027 Book:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Come-Out-Her-People-1930-1965/dp/B0CZRMM8WQ",

Mystika, a licensed mental health clinician and street preacher from Upstate New York, discusses her involvement in the NAR movement and the challenges she faced. She describes how she was drawn to the movement, believing it to be the true representation of the church. Mystika recounts how she was identified as an evangelist by a church leader and how this recognition made her feel valued and significant. She explains that her involvement in the movement led her to become deeply involved in deliverance ministry, where she dealt with people believed to be demon-possessed.\n\n\nMystika also discusses the fear-based environment of the NAR church, where members were constantly on guard against demons and witchcraft. She describes bizarre and unsettling incidents, such as a church leader manifesting a \u0022python spirit\u0022 and the ensuing chaotic deliverance session. Despite the support and recognition she received, Mystika eventually began to question the teachings and practices of the NAR movement. Her growing doubts, combined with prayer and the support of concerned friends, helped her break free from the church.

      "description": "More Information:\nhttps://william-branham.org/site/research/people/john_wimber\n\nJohn Wimber was a significant figure in charismatic Christianity, playing a pivotal role in the Vineyard movement and the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR). His theology emphasized supernatural experiences, particularly through miraculous healings and prophetic utterances, which he referred to as \u0022signs and wonders.\u0022 Wimber\u0027s work at Fuller Theological Seminary, alongside C. Peter Wagner, contributed to the growth of \u0022power evangelism,\u0022 a method that integrated charismatic practices with traditional evangelicalism. Wimber\u0027s approach was heavily influenced by Kingdom Now theology and the Pentecostal movement, and he advocated for Christians to exert dominion over the earthly realm. Despite being celebrated for revitalizing congregations, Wimber\u0027s legacy is also criticized for its uncritical embrace of questionable prophetic figures, such as the Kansas City Prophets, and its emphasis on experiential spirituality, which some argue overshadowed sound biblical exegesis.\n\nWimber\u0027s leadership of the Vineyard movement was instrumental in shaping modern charismatic Christianity. The Toronto Blessing, a revival characterized by extreme emotional and physical manifestations, drew criticism for its bizarre phenomena, leading Wimber to distance himself from the movement. Nevertheless, his influence persisted through the endorsement of controversial figures like Paul Cain and Bob Jones. Wimber\u0027s impact on the International House of Prayer (IHOP-KC) and his connection to Latter Rain doctrines solidified his role in modern NAR theology. His legacy of promoting supernatural experiences as a core aspect of faith continues to shape evangelical and charismatic movements, though not without significant scrutiny regarding its theological and pastoral soundness.\n\n00:00 Introduction  \n00:15 John Wimber\u0027s Background and Influence on Charismatic Christianity  \n01:16 The Theology of Power Evangelism and Kingdom Now  \n02:48 Wimber\u2019s Connections with C.

Central to this doctrine is the belief that Christians are divinely mandated to seize control of seven key societal spheres\u2014religion, family, education, government, media, arts and entertainment, and business\u2014to establish a dominionist Christian society. Explore how this mandate is rooted in dominion theology, influenced by movements such as the Latter Rain, and examines the figure of Loren Cunningham, founder of Youth With A Mission (YWAM), whose vision helped solidify this ideological framework. Critics argue that the Seven Mountain Mandate is a direct challenge to democratic values and religious pluralism, with some believing it aims to foster Christian supremacy.\n\nCunningham\u0027s early connections to charismatic and Pentecostal movements, including his support of William Branham and his involvement in the Latter Rain movement, are discussed in detail. Allegations of cult-like behavior and political manipulation surrounding YWAM are also explored, along with Cunningham\u0027s role in co-developing the Seven Mountain Mandate.  \n\n00:00 Introduction  \n00:15 The Seven Mountain Mandate Overview  \n01:29 Origins and Theocratic Vision  \n02:50 Dominion Theology and Apostles\u0027 Leadership  \n03:48 Loren Cunningham and YWAM\u2019s Early Foundations  \n05:20 YWAM\u0027s Global Expansion and Controversies  \n06:13 Connections to Christian Nationalism and the Latter Rain  \n07:28 Criticisms and Allegations Against YWAM  \n08:41 The Role of YWAM in Political and Religious Influence  \n09:34 Kennedy, Peace Corps, and the Christian Right Response  \n10:56 YWAM\u2019s Alignment with Political Christian Movements  \n12:15 Seven Mountain Mandate\u2019s Ongoing Influence and Criticisms\n\n______________________\n\u2013 Support the channel: https://www.patreon.com/branham\n\u2013 Subscribe to the channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBSpezVG15TVG-lOYMRXuyQ\n\u2013 Visit the website: https://william-branham.org\n\u2013 Follow on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WilliamBranhamOrg \n\u2013 Follow on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@william.m.branham\n\u2013 Follow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/wmbhr\n\u2013 Buy the books: https://william-branham.org/site/books",

The hosts discuss the emerging doctrinal themes of the NAR, such as dominion theology and end-time prophecies, questioning their alignment with traditional Christian beliefs. They highlight disturbing elements within the NAR, such as the militarization of theology and the conflation of Christian and non-Christian spiritual ideas, warning that these trends may lead to a false kingdom with a false Christ. The conversation reflects on how the NAR borrows from both New Age and Gnostic teachings, with figures like Jane Leade and Alice Bailey being cited for their influence on modern religious movements.\n\nAs the hosts explore these connections, they focus on the alarming parallels between the NAR and occult beliefs. They discuss figures like\u00A0Aleister Crowley and his influence on religious thinking, and how some NAR leaders are adopting practices and ideologies that align with esoteric and Luciferian thought. The episode also reflects on how deceptive teachings can slowly erode the line between good and evil, leading believers into dangerous territory. By tracing the theological roots and contemporary manifestations of these movements, the hosts provide a critical analysis that seeks to expose their underlying dangers, particularly for Christians who may unknowingly be led astray by these teachings.",

      "description": "More information:\nhttps://william-branham.org/site/research/people/ern_baxter\n\n Ern Baxter was pivotal in the Pentecostal, Latter Rain, and Charismatic movements. Baxter\u2019s work as a campaign manager and Bible teacher for William Branham shaped many doctrines, particularly in the controversial Shepherding movement, which emphasized authoritarian leadership. The movement\u2019s control over its followers, paired with psychological and spiritual abuse, is highlighted as a destructive force, leaving a lasting influence on the authoritarian structures within the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR). Baxter\u2019s life is traced from his early ministry beginnings in 1932, through his leadership in the Evangelistic Tabernacle of Vancouver, to his collaboration with William Branham during the Latter Rain revival. His involvement in promoting Branham\u2019s alleged angelic visitations and the healing campaigns further entrenched his influence across the Charismatic movement.\n\nThe narrative also covers the eventual fallout between Baxter and Branham, focusing on the doctrinal rifts, particularly over Branham\u2019s serpent seed doctrine, which had connections to white supremacist ideologies. Baxter distanced himself from Branham after realizing the harmful effects of Branham\u2019s teachings. However, his departure was met with attempts to discredit his character, including accusations of misconduct and immoral behavior. The legacy of these movements, the abuses, and the doctrinal controversies are laid out as pivotal moments that shaped the direction of the Charismatic movement and its authoritarian structures.\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:15 Ern Baxter\u2019s Role in the Revival Movements\n01:43 Baxter\u2019s Early Ministry and Pentecostal Roots\n03:02 The Evangelistic Tabernacle and Baxter\u2019s Leadership\n04:15 Collaboration with William Branham\n05:29 The Healing Revivals and Branham\u2019s Miracles\n07:00 Doctrinal Controversies and the Serpent Seed Teaching\n08:21 Baxter\u2019s Exit from Branham\u2019s Campaign and the Aftermath\n\n______________________\n\u2013 Support the channel: https://www.patreon.com/branham\n\u2013 Subscribe to the channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBSpezVG15TVG-lOYMRXuyQ\n\u2013 Visit the website: https://william-branham.org\n\u2013 Follow on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WilliamBranhamOrg \n\u2013 Follow on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@william.m.branham\n\u2013 Follow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/wmbhr\n\u2013 Buy the books: https://william-branham.org/site/books",

His evangelical career began in the late 1940s, during the height of the Latter Rain movement, and he maintained strong connections with key figures like William Branham, despite the Assemblies of God denouncing the movement as heretical. Rodgers\u0027s ministry expanded rapidly, and he became known for hosting major revival events featuring influential figures from the Latter Rain and Charismatic movements. His Evangel Tabernacle in Owensboro, Kentucky, became a focal point for these movements, attracting notable names like Pat Robertson and Colonel Harland Sanders.\n\nDespite his success, Rodgers\u0027s ministry was marred by controversy, particularly legal battles involving financial misconduct. One of the most significant cases involved a lawsuit filed by Betty Lee Cox, who accused Evangel Tabernacle of fraudulent bond sales for a church construction project. Later, Rodgers\u0027s son, Bob Rodgers, continued his father\u0027s legacy but became embroiled in further controversies, including allegations of financial mismanagement related to a trust fund and involvement in the New Apostolic Reformation\u0027s political agenda. Bob Rodgers gained notoriety for his fiery sermons, particularly those claiming the 2020 U.S. Presidential election was stolen, where he invoked curses upon those he believed were responsible.\n\n00:00 Introduction  \n00:15 Early Life and Conversion  \n01:06 Evangelical Career and Latter Rain Connections  \n02:56 Growth of Evangel Tabernacle  \n03:54 Legal Controversies and Financial Misconduct  \n05:30 Legacy and Bob Rodgers\u2019s Controversial Ministry\n______________________\n\u2013 Support the channel: https://www.patreon.com/branham\n\u2013 Subscribe to the channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBSpezVG15TVG-lOYMRXuyQ\n\u2013 Visit the website: https://william-branham.org\n\u2013 Follow on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WilliamBranhamOrg \n\u2013 Follow on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@william.m.branham\n\u2013 Follow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/wmbhr\n\u2013 Buy the books: https://william-branham.org/site/books",

The discussion then delves into the misinterpretation of Genesis 1:28 by NAR leaders, who claim that Christians should dominate these societal mountains, which critics argue is a flawed exegesis.\n\nThe narrative progresses by tracing the NAR\u0027s theological lineage to Christian Identity, particularly through figures like Wesley Swift, who propagated anti-Semitic and anti-Catholic views under the guise of Christian doctrine. These ideas were later absorbed and repackaged by leaders like William Branham, influencing the development of the NAR\u0027s theology.

      "description": "Cyrus Ingerson Scofield is a controversial figure in American Christianity, primarily known for his Scofield Reference Bible published in 1909. This Bible, with its dispensationalist notes, had a profound impact on Evangelical and fundamentalist Christianity. Scofield\u0027s study notes provided a structured, literal interpretation of the Bible, emphasizing prophecy and the end times. His influence extended beyond his lifetime, deeply embedding dispensationalism in movements such as fundamentalism, Pentecostalism, the Latter Rain movement, and the New Apostolic Reformation. \n\nScofield\u0027s early career was marked by political and legal scandals. As a probate attorney in Kansas, he engaged in various fraudulent activities, leading to his resignation from federal office and subsequent arrest for forgery. While serving time, Scofield claimed a dramatic conversion to Evangelical Christianity, entering the ministry and rising to prominence. His association with Dwight Moody and mentorship under James Brooks solidified his theological foundation. The Scofield Reference Bible, particularly its dispensationalist framework, became a cornerstone for Christian fundamentalism and Pentecostalism, influencing their teachings and eschatological views.\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:16 The Impact of the Scofield Reference Bible\n01:00 Scofield\u0027s Dispensationalism and Influence\n02:00 Early Political Career and Scandals\n04:20 Conversion and Rise in Evangelical Christianity\n05:00 Theological Foundation and Associations\n05:27 Influence on Fundamentalism and Pentecostalism\n06:50 Role in the Latter Rain Movement\n08:07 Scofield\u0027s Influence on the New Apostolic Reformation \n\n______________________\n\u2013 Support the channel: https://www.patreon.com/branham\n\u2013 Subscribe to the channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBSpezVG15TVG-lOYMRXuyQ\n\u2013 Visit the website: https://william-branham.org\n\u2013 Follow on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WilliamBranhamOrg \n\u2013 Follow on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@william.m.branham\n\u2013 Follow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/wmbhr\n\u2013 Buy the books: https://william-branham.org/site/books",

They critically examine the bizarre and harmful doctrines propagated by these Latter Rain / NAR movements, such as the notion that true Christians are identifiable by their adherence to specific cult practices, like dress codes or loyalty to particular leaders. This elitist ideology creates a sense of spiritual arrogance and judgmental attitudes among followers, leading to a closed-off, insular community. The hosts also discuss the historical roots of these beliefs, tracing back to the early Pentecostal and Latter Rain revivals, and how these ideas have evolved and persisted over time.

      "description": "More information and references:\nhttps://william-branham.org/site/research/people/bob_jones\n\nBob Jones and William Branham are influential yet controversial figures within the charismatic movement, each having a significant impact on its development. Jones was known for his alleged prophetic visions, dreams, and involvement with the Kansas City Prophets and the International House of Prayer (IHOP) in Kansas City. His ministry was marked by claims of supernatural experiences and guiding the future of the New Apostolic Reformation. Similarly, Branham, revered as a powerful prophet in American history, had a ministry filled with detailed prophecies, many of which were believed to be accurate by his followers. Both men shared histories of claimed supernatural experiences and struggles with mental health, which they described as encounters with the divine.\n\nThe transcript delves into the controversial nature of their ministries, highlighting allegations of misconduct, false prophecies, and connections to occult practices. Jones\u0027 influence on Mike Bickle and the Kansas City Fellowship is evident as he convinced Bickle of grand prophetic visions and a new order of Christianity. Branham\u0027s legacy in the Latter Rain movement and his connections to questionable figures like the Ku Klux Klan are explored, showing how his doctrines influenced subsequent charismatic leaders. The blending of metaphysical beliefs with Christian teachings and the perpetuation of failed prophecies by both Jones and Branham underscore the contentious aspects of their ministries.\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:15 Mike Bickle Praising William Branham\n01:00 Bob Jones and the Kansas City Prophets\n01:46 Bob Jones\u0027 Alleged Sinful Past and Parallels to Branham\n02:35 Leadership Issues and Ignored Misconduct\n03:00 Sexual Misconduct Allegations in Bickle\u0027s Ministry\n03:54 Bob Jones\u0027 Influence on Mike Bickle\n04:52 Jones\u0027 Alleged Visions and New Order of Christianity\n05:37 Controversies and Occult Practices\n06:30 Jones\u0027 Energy Transference Beliefs\n07:00 Failed Prophecies and the Stock Market Crash\n07:50 Recreating Branham\u0027s Ministry and Stage Persona\n08:25 Branham\u0027s Revival History and Controversial Associations\n09:00 The Angel \u0022Emma\u0022 and Revival Influences\n09:50 Manifest Sons of God Doctrine and End Times Army\n10:20 References\n\n______________________\n\u2013 Support the channel: https://www.patreon.com/branham\n\u2013 Subscribe to the channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBSpezVG15TVG-lOYMRXuyQ\n\u2013 Visit the website: https://william-branham.org\n\u2013 Follow on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WilliamBranhamOrg \n\u2013 Follow on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@william.m.branham\n\u2013 Follow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/wmbhr\n\u2013 Buy the books: https://william-branham.org/site/books",

We examine how early influences, particularly from figures like William Branham and Jane Lead, have shaped modern teachings in these movements. They delve into the blending of Christian and New Age ideas, particularly focusing on concepts like the Manifest Sons of God, eschatological perfection, and the so-called sacred purge. The episode highlights the significant overlaps between New Age beliefs and the teachings of the NAR, suggesting a convergence of these streams of thought over time.\n\n\nJohn and Steve emphasize the dangers of these converging apostate teachings, particularly how they manipulate biblical texts to promote elitist and often harmful ideologies. The discussion also touches on the historical contexts that have allowed these ideas to proliferate, including the influence of Christian Identity teachings and their racist underpinnings.

      "description": "Resources and additional information:\nhttps://william-branham.org/site/research/people/kenneth_copeland\n\nKenneth Copeland is a prominent American televangelist and founder of Kenneth Copeland Ministries, known for its emphasis on Prosperity theology. This doctrine teaches that faith, positive speech, and donations can lead to financial and physical blessings. Copeland\u0027s ministry has a global reach through television, radio broadcasts, books, and international crusades. He has built significant political ties, notably supporting former President Donald Trump and serving on Trump\u0027s Evangelical Executive Advisory Board. Copeland\u0027s wealth and influence are substantial, with a headquarters featuring an extensive campus, a private airstrip, and luxury properties. His personal lifestyle, including owning multiple private jets, has drawn scrutiny and criticism, yet his teachings continue to attract a large following.\n\nCopeland\u0027s rise in the evangelical world is closely tied to the Latter Rain movement of the late 1940s, which emphasized the restoration of apostolic gifts such as healing and prophecy. Influenced by figures like William Branham and Oral Roberts, Copeland incorporated elements of the Latter Rain movement into his ministry. His teachings on prosperity and the power of spoken words to manifest physical and financial realities are foundational to the Word of Faith movement. Copeland\u0027s message of prosperity theology has faced significant criticism for its perceived exploitation of vulnerable believers, yet the movement continues to grow with Copeland at the forefront, leveraging his extensive media platform to reach a global audience.\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:16 Overview of Kenneth Copeland\u0027s Ministry \n01:43 Influence of the Latter Rain Movement\n03:08 Connection with Oral Roberts\n03:46 Influence of William Branham\u0027s Teachings\n04:00 Influence of the Word of Faith Movement\n04:26 Influence of William Branham\u0027s Deity Cult\n05:12 Prosperity Gospel and Positive Confession\n05:50 Influence of John Alexander Dowie\n06:58 Criticism of Prosperity Theology\n07:41 Influence on the New Apostolic Reformation \n______________________\n\u2013 Support the channel: https://www.patreon.com/branham\n\u2013 Subscribe to the channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBSpezVG15TVG-lOYMRXuyQ\n\u2013 Visit the website: https://william-branham.org\n\u2013 Follow on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WilliamBranhamOrg \n\u2013 Follow on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@william.m.branham\n\u2013 Follow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/wmbhr\n\u2013 Buy the books: https://william-branham.org/site/books",

      "description": "The networking strategy of key figures in the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) has significantly contributed to the movement\u0027s growth and internal strength. This strategy allowed independent charismatic ministries to support one another while functioning autonomously. Critics outside the NAR express concern over the perceived abandonment of sound theology and the spread of false doctrines, as leaders with limited theological understanding introduce extra-biblical themes. The NAR aims to create an Endtime Revival to claim dominion over various Christian denominations and non-Christians, focusing on pop culture and democratic individualism. The movement\u0027s networking strategy involves re-evaluating past Christian practices to bring about a global revival, essentially rewriting the DNA of Christianity.\n\nThe NAR\u0027s development into a social movement can be traced back to the Social Gospel, which merged church and politics to address social issues. Figures like Charles Oliver Brown and Washington Gladden laid the groundwork for this movement, with Baptist theologian Walter Rauschenbusch furthering its theological framework. C. Peter Wagner, a key figure in the NAR, built upon the Social Gospel concepts, introducing the idea of engaging in spiritual warfare against demonic forces. Wagner\u0027s portrayal of the NAR as a militant band of spiritual warriors has led to controversy and violence, as members adopt an insiders versus outsiders mentality. The NAR\u0027s objective to claim dominion over societal spheres involves establishing a strongly networked presence within them, although this has raised concerns about the movement\u0027s influence on political and social changes.\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:17 Networking Strategy and Growth \n02:56 Historical Context of Social Gospel\n04:47 Influence of Henry George and Social Reform \n06:51 C.

Jesse shares his story of growing up in a family that was initially not very religious, but gradually became more involved in church activities. He experienced a significant spiritual event at the age of 15, which led him to have a vision about confronting the Pope. This vision marked the beginning of Jesse\u0027s deep spiritual journey, leading him to various religious experiences, including speaking in tongues.\n\nAs Jesse\u0027s journey continues, he describes how he got involved in different denominations and eventually came across the teachings of William Branham. Jesse was drawn to Branham\u0027s emphasis on healings and spiritual experiences, which led him to leave his previous church and Bible school. He then delves into his deeper involvement with other movements and teachings, including those of Bill Britton and the sonship movement. Over time, Jesse became more isolated in his beliefs, leading to conflicts with mainstream denominations and eventually joining a church in the NAR network. Jesse\u0027s story highlights the dangers of spiritual deception and the importance of seeking the truth with a humble heart.",

      "description": "Recently, Perry Stone resurrected a so-called \u0022vision\u0022 that William Branham claimed to have been fulfilled in the 1960s. Considering the complex relationship between Evangelical Christianity, particularly within the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR), and past failed prophecies concerning the 2020 election, this is shaping up to be a battle of the \u0022prophets.\u0022\n\nEvangelical leaders in the NAR have made numerous prophecies about political outcomes, positioning Trump as a defender of Christian values despite his controversial personal conduct. His policies resonate with these groups, who see his re-election as a means to validate their prophetic claims after his loss in 2020. In contrast, Harris is portrayed negatively, her progressive stances seen as antithetical to Evangelical beliefs, marking her potential victory as a spiritual defeat. \n\nThis video examines the origins of prophetic political involvement within Evangelical circles regarding presidential campaigns, tracing back to the 1944 election and the influence of figures like Roy E. Davis and Gerald Burton Winrod. These early leaders used their platforms to merge Christian fundamentalism with political agendas, laying the groundwork for future prophetic claims. William Branham\u2019s evolving prophecies, including a controversial vision of a female president, exemplify the fluid nature of these predictions, which are often retrofitted to suit current political climates.

They discuss the pattern of abuse and the exploitation of followers within various religious movements, noting how leaders like Freeman manipulated their congregations, resulting in significant harm and legal scrutiny. They highlight instances where followers, indoctrinated with the belief of spiritual healing, suffered severe consequences, including death, due to the rejection of medical treatment. The podcast also addresses the broader issue of how religious leaders control information to maintain their influence over their followers.\n\nThe conversation emphasizes the difficulty ex-cult members face in adjusting to life outside the cult. Many struggle with residual indoctrination and find it challenging to reconcile their beliefs with new, healthier religious environments. The hosts stress the importance of therapy and proper guidance for those recovering from such experiences. They also discuss the legislative changes that occurred in response to the alarming death rates within these groups, showcasing the evolving legal landscape aimed at protecting vulnerable individuals from the harmful practices of exploitative religious leaders.",

      "description": "John Paul Jackson\u2019s journey in the realm of prophetic ministry began with a decade-long focus on the gospels and the book of Acts. A turning point came when he was influenced by a prophecy related to Romans chapter 4, which he read daily for three years. Jackson, a significant figure within the charismatic movement, is known for his work on dreams and biblical interpretations. His ministry was marked by his time with the Kansas City prophets, a group known for its controversial practices and doctrines. Despite facing criticism for his failed predictions, Jackson\u2019s influence persisted, and he became a crucial figure in the formation of IHOP-KC and the New Apostolic Reformation.\n\nReferences here:\nhttps://william-branham.org/site/research/people/john_paul_jackson\n______________________\n\u2013 Support the channel: https://www.patreon.com/branham\n\u2013 Subscribe to the channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBSpezVG15TVG-lOYMRXuyQ\n\u2013 Visit the website: https://william-branham.org\n\u2013 Follow on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WilliamBranhamOrg \n\u2013 Follow on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@william.m.branham\n\u2013 Follow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/wmbhr\n\u2013 Buy the books: https://william-branham.org/site/books",

      "description": "Support the show:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/branham\n\nAvailable on Spotify, Google, and Apple Podcasts:\nhttps://william-branham.org/podcast\n\nJohn Collins and McKinnon examine how weaponized religion, particularly white supremacist ideologies, intertwined with early Christian fundamentalism to lay the groundwork for the New Apostolic Reformation. The conversation traces the rise and fall of the Klan\u0027s influence, highlighting Davis\u0027s pivotal role in shifting from overtly militant activities to embedding those ideologies within religious movements for financial gain.\n\nThe discussion emphasizes the significant influence of individuals like Gerald Winrod and John Alexander Dowie on Davis and Branham. These figures, known for their controversial and often fraudulent religious activities, provided a template for Davis and Branham\u0027s operations. The transcript reveals how Davis, initially involved in the KKK, transitioned to leading Pentecostal sects, exploiting the financial potential of religious movements. This shift is portrayed as a strategic move to continue propagating supremacist ideologies under the guise of religious revivalism, with Branham eventually adopting and expanding these themes in his own ministry.",

      "description": "Weaponized Religion: From Christian Identity to the NAR:\nhttps://william-branham.org/site/books/weaponized_religion_from_christian_identity_to_the_nar\n \nThe NAR has a relatively unexplored link to very dangerous conspiracy theories. One such theory is the so-called \u0022Serpent DNA.\u0022  We examine Matthew Taylor Coleman, who was convinced that his children inherited serpent DNA. Coleman murdered them in a bid to prevent their transformation into reptilians. Anthony Quinn Warner, similarly influenced, detonated an RV in Nashville, driven by a fear of an impending takeover by \u201Clizard people.\u201D These events underscore the dangerous impact of conspiracy theories on individuals and their actions. Yet this strange conspiracy has ties to NAR history.\n\nIt is imperative that we examine the infiltration of these conspiracy theories into segments of Evangelical Christianity, with the serpent DNA theory being just one notable example. The origins of this and other related doctrines can be identified by exploring how British Israelism evolved into Christian Identity through figures like Russell Kelso Carter and the adoption of the two-seed doctrine. The influence of these doctrines extended into the latter rain movement and was prominently featured in the teachings of leaders such as William Branham.  \n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:17 Coleman\u2019s Confession and Serpent DNA Theory\n01:09 Warner\u2019s RV Explosion in Nashville\n01:59 QAnon and the Rise of Conspiracy Theories\n02:46 Evangelical Adoption of QAnon Theories\n03:50 British Israelism\u2019s Racial Evolution\n04:48 Russell Kelso Carter and the Two-Seed Doctrine\n06:04 The Tree of Knowledge and Original Sin\n07:03 Integration of Heretical Beliefs\n07:59 Daniel Parker and Predestination\n08:47 Merging of Doctrines and White Supremacy\n09:49 Christian Identity Movement and Anti-Semitism\n11:00 Spread of Doctrines by George Hawtin and William Branham\n12:06 William Branham\u2019s Influence on Healing Revivals\n13:01 Conclusion and Further Investigation into Azusa Street Revival\n\n______________________\n\u2013 Support the channel: https://www.patreon.com/branham\n\u2013 Subscribe to the channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBSpezVG15TVG-lOYMRXuyQ\n\u2013 Visit the website: https://william-branham.org\n\u2013 Follow on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WilliamBranhamOrg \n\u2013 Follow on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@william.m.branham\n\u2013 Follow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/wmbhr\n\u2013 Buy the books: https://william-branham.org/site/books",

Destiny shares her journey of growing up in a highly religious household while attending public school. This dual experience led her to question the strict religious doctrines she was raised with. Her father, a preacher, enforced rules that clashed with the norms of her public school environment, creating internal conflict. Destiny describes her unique upbringing, characterized by frequent disagreements with her father over dress codes and other religious mandates. Her mother, though supportive, also faced the challenge of navigating these strict expectations. Despite the constraints, Destiny excelled academically and planned to use education as her path to independence.\n\nAs she matured, Destiny\u0027s critical thinking grew stronger, leading her to question the exclusivity and rigid practices of the Message. Her father\u0027s severe accident and subsequent need for intensive care became a pivotal moment, causing a shift in family dynamics and religious practices. Destiny reflects on the superficial nature of religious appearances within the Message and the importance of developing personal strength and a clear exit strategy for those wishing to leave similar environments. She emphasizes the value of education and independent thought, offering encouragement to others in similar situations to find their path and hold onto their convictions.",

Networks of ministries led by apostles and prophets, who claim to receive extra-biblical revelations from God for new doctrines, began to intersect. Each intersection point spawned a new NAR network to further develop and add to those doctrines. By January 1997, groups focused on the concept of \u0022spiritual warfare\u0022 had grown so large that they were reorganized as the United States Spiritual Warfare Prayer Network (USSPN).

As leaders of a group convinced they are engaged in spiritual warfare within a vivid realm of angels and demons, these authoritarian figures assume the role of \u0027generals\u0027 in an army. The rank-and-file members, serving merely as privates, are enlisted in a battle they do not fully comprehend.\n\nThe concept is widely promoted in the series titled \u201CGod\u2019s Generals,\u201D which, to the NAR, has become akin to the Books of Kings from the Old Testament. In these works, author Roberts Liardon chronicles the lineage of pivotal figures in the NAR\u0027s formation, dubbing some of the most influential among them as \u0022generals.\u0022 This viewpoint suggests that, historically, the Holy Spirit has opted to guide Christians through individual leaders rather than directly through the believers\u0027 hearts, in opposition to New Testament teachings such as Romans 5:5.\n______________________\n\u2013 Support the channel: https://www.patreon.com/branham\n\u2013 Subscribe to the channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBSpezVG15TVG-lOYMRXuyQ\n\u2013 Visit the website: https://william-branham.org\n\u2013 Follow on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WilliamBranhamOrg \n\u2013 Follow on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@william.m.branham\n\u2013 Follow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/wmbhr\n\u2013 Buy the books: https://william-branham.org/site/books",

Among those mentioned were Todd Bentley, Mike Bickle, Jon Crowder, Rick Joyner, and others. Rather than abandon the destructive theology, the group continued to recruit for the so-called army, and new \u0022generals\u0022 were appointed to lead. How did this army form? What is their mission? To find out, we must explore the origins of the Manifested Sons of God.\n\nSPLC:\nhttps://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2008/todd-bentley%E2%80%99s-militant-joel%E2%80%99s-army-gains-followers-florida\n______________________\n\u2013 Support the channel: https://www.patreon.com/branham\n\u2013 Subscribe to the channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBSpezVG15TVG-lOYMRXuyQ\n\u2013 Visit the website: https://william-branham.org\n\u2013 Follow on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WilliamBranhamOrg \n\u2013 Follow on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@william.m.branham\n\u2013 Follow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/wmbhr\n\u2013 Buy the books: https://william-branham.org/site/books",

      "description": "Weaponized Religion: From Christian Identity to the NAR:\nhttps://william-branham.org/site/books/weaponized_religion_from_christian_identity_to_the_nar\n\nThe video explores the influential rise of the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR), an Evangelical Christian movement aiming to assert dominion over key societal domains, including politics, business, and culture. It discusses the movement\u0027s leaders who view themselves as divinely appointed Apostles and Prophets preparing for Jesus Christ\u0027s return. The narrative delves into the origins and key figures of the movement, such as C. Peter Wagner, and highlights the controversial practices and ideologies, including \u0027spiritual warfare\u0027 to control societal structures. Additionally, it covers the \u0022Seven Mountain Mandate,\u0022 which is the strategy to infiltrate and dominate sectors like business to fund their religious campaign.\n\nThe content also examines the movement\u0027s connections to historical and controversial theological trends like British Israelism, and discusses influential figures like A.B. Simpson, whose teachings impacted the Pentecostal and Charismatic movements. The video contrasts early Christian practices with the NAR\u0027s modern strategies, particularly their focus on accumulating wealth to fund their vision of a global Christian governance. It critically analyzes the shift in missionary work from spiritual service to strategic financial operations, reflecting on how these changes align with or deviate from traditional Christian values.\n\n______________________\n\u2013 Support the channel: https://www.patreon.com/branham\n\u2013 Subscribe to the channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBSpezVG15TVG-lOYMRXuyQ\n\u2013 Visit the website: https://william-branham.org\n\u2013 Follow on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WilliamBranhamOrg \n\u2013 Follow on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@william.m.branham\n\u2013 Follow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/wmbhr\n\u2013 Buy the books: https://william-branham.org/site/books\n\nYouTube Chapters:\n0:00 - Introduction to the New Apostolic Reformation\n0:17 - Terry Gross\u0027s NPR Expose on NAR\u0027s Influence\n0:33 - Ideological Foundations and Dominion Theology\n1:04 - Understanding the \u0022Seven Mountain Mandate\u0022\n1:43 - Controversial Tactics: Spiritual Warfare for Societal Control\n2:00 - The Business Mountain: Funding Religious Dominance\n3:01 - Comparisons with Early Christian Missionary Practices\n3:25 - A.B.

      "description": "Weaponized Religion: From Christian Identity to the NAR:\nhttps://william-branham.org/site/books/weaponized_religion_from_christian_identity_to_the_nar\n\nThe episode delves into the deep-seated roots and development of Christian nationalism in the United States, particularly focusing on figures like Gerald L.K. Smith and the movement\u2019s ties to white supremacy. Smith, a Christian nationalist and minister, was known for his efforts to preserve America as a Christian nation, using platforms like his publication \u0022The Cross and the Flag\u0022 to spread his ideology. The narrative tracks the historical backdrop of Smith\u0027s activism against a broader canvas of racial and religious prejudices, tracing it back to early American history and European colonial mandates, which justified conquest and subjugation in the name of Christianity.\n\nThe discussion spans from the inception of Christian nationalism in the 15th century with the papal decrees that led to the oppression of non-Christians, through the racial and religious conflicts in post-Civil War America, to the 19th-century spread of British Israelism. This doctrine posited that Western Europeans and their descendants were the true heirs of biblical promises. Influential figures like Professor C. Totten of Yale promoted these views, intertwining them with American nationalism and militarism. The video explores how these religious and racial ideologies were propagated through political movements and religious teachings, ultimately influencing major social and political developments in American history.\n\n______________________\n\u2013 Support the channel: https://www.patreon.com/branham\n\u2013 Subscribe to the channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBSpezVG15TVG-lOYMRXuyQ\n\u2013 Visit the website: https://william-branham.org\n\u2013 Follow on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WilliamBranhamOrg \n\u2013 Follow on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@william.m.branham\n\u2013 Follow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/wmbhr\n\u2013 Buy the books: https://william-branham.org/site/books\n\nChapters:\n0:00 - Introduction to Christian Nationalism\n0:17 - Gerald L.K.
