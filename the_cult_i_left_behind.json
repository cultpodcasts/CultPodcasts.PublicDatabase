It also turns out couples who can\u0027t have biological children shouldn\u0027t adopt because, according to Bill, God doesn\u0027t think they should be parents. Amanda explains the concept of \u0022sins of the father\u0022 and how Bill taught adopted kids brought the sins of their lineage into their adoptive families. Amanda and Kyle discuss how Bill found every conceivable way to exert power and control over IBLP cult members and what Amanda left behind from cult ideology around adoption.",

Turns out growing up in the IBLP cult means there\u0027s a lot of slang and innuendo that goes right over your head. A best practice is probably not to repeat any new phrases until you Google them, but sadly that is not what happened. Amanda also tells Kyle about some of her greatest successes in the military and how growing up in a cult helped her cope with military training and other high-pressure environments. Kyle asks Amanda the greatest hinderance she faced as a female cult kid who went into a STEM career field in the military, and it just so happens that you really do need to know more math than fractions. But also, according to the cult, females are not supposed to be in the military. This episode (or at least the good parts of this episode) is dedicated to the men and women with whom Amanda served, will forever love, and for whom she will always be grateful. Correction: Amanda mentions \u0022431 paperwork\u0022 in the episode. What she referred to is actually called AETC Form 341 .",
