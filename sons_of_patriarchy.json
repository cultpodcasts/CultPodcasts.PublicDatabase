Most were known by their rhetorical power, calvinistic soteriology, and movement-building prowess. But they\u0027ve all got a spiritual father, a Patriarch, if you will.\nMaybe you listened to the 2021 podcast series \u0022The Rise and Fall of Mars Hill,\u0022 and wondered, \u0022Where did Driscoll come from?\u0022 Well, he took what Doug Wilson had written, and preached it. Driscoll appealed to men like never before, with an in-your-face message, that beat you up and left you satisfied, longing for more. Many others have followed in his wake, but like all modern philosophers to Plato, they\u0027re simply building on Wilson.\nListen in as we talk with Nick Gier, Professor Emeritus at the University of Idaho (Doug\u0027s former professor), and Russell Moore, Editor in Chief at Christianity Today, about Doug\u0027s beginnings, those whom he\u0027s influenced, and where they see this going.\n\u00A0\n\u0022Sons of Patriarchy\u0022 is brought to you by\nProducer, Writer, Editor, and Host: Peter Bell\nOriginal Music, Sound Design, and Mixing: https://aaronfeeneymusic.com/\nSocial Media: Sarah Bader\nGraphic Design: Anonymous Survivors\nSURVIVORS - THANK YOU, AND MAY YOU BE HEARD.",
