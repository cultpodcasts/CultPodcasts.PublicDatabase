Figure out where this thing called Christian Nationalism came from.\nCatholic Integralism is both intellectually superior of, and far more historically grounded counterpart to Christian Nationalism. Kevin Vallier (Professor of Philosophy at the University of Toledo) discusses the rise of Catholic Integralism, the Protestant response, and where Christian Nationalism fits into that picture (if it does at all).\nFrom Catholic Integralism, we move forward a few hundred hears to the founding of the American Republic. Jerome Copulsky (Research Fellow at the Berkley Center at Georgetown University) analyzes the political and religious traditions of the 18th and 19th centuries, dispelling rumors about America\u0027s founding while providing a politically (and religiously) robust reading of the nation\u0027s constitution and supporting documents.\nAll the Kingdoms of the World by Kevin Vallier\nAmerican Heretics by Jerome Copulsky\n\u00A0\nDonate to help the survivor network here.\nJoin: Private Survivor Support Group.\nSign up for our Patreon here.\nVisit sonsofpatriarchy.com to find resources, recommended reading, and more.\nSocial Media: Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, and TikTok.\nExamining Doug Wilson and Moscow: Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook\n\u00A0\n\u0022Sons of Patriarchy\u0022 is brought to you by\nProducer, Writer, Editor, and Host: Peter Bell\nOriginal Music, Sound Design, and Mixing: https://aaronfeeneymusic.com/\nSocial Media: Sarah Bader\nGraphic Design: Anonymous Survivors\nSURVIVORS - THANK YOU, AND MAY YOU BE HEARD.",

Most were known by their rhetorical power, calvinistic soteriology, and movement-building prowess. But they\u0027ve all got a spiritual father, a Patriarch, if you will.\nMaybe you listened to the 2021 podcast series \u0022The Rise and Fall of Mars Hill,\u0022 and wondered, \u0022Where did Driscoll come from?\u0022 Well, he took what Doug Wilson had written, and preached it. Driscoll appealed to men like never before, with an in-your-face message, that beat you up and left you satisfied, longing for more. Many others have followed in his wake, but like all modern philosophers to Plato, they\u0027re simply building on Wilson.\nListen in as we talk with Nick Gier, Professor Emeritus at the University of Idaho (Doug\u0027s former professor), and Russell Moore, Editor in Chief at Christianity Today, about Doug\u0027s beginnings, those whom he\u0027s influenced, and where they see this going.\n\u00A0\n\u0022Sons of Patriarchy\u0022 is brought to you by\nProducer, Writer, Editor, and Host: Peter Bell\nOriginal Music, Sound Design, and Mixing: https://aaronfeeneymusic.com/\nSocial Media: Sarah Bader\nGraphic Design: Anonymous Survivors\nSURVIVORS - THANK YOU, AND MAY YOU BE HEARD.",
