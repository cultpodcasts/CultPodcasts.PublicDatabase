      "description": "One Tree Hill Star Bethany Joy Lenz talks with PEOPLE about how she got sucked into a cult for a decade \u2014 and how she finally got out of it. Bethany starred as Haley James in The WB / The CW show that aired for nine seasons. Bethany shares how her religious upbringing and her desire for connection lead to her joining a cult during her time at One Tree Hill:  \u0022I have always been looking for a place to belong, I kinda wish someone had told me when I was young this is the universal human condition.\u0022\n\nBethany discusses how her recovery after leaving the cult and her marriage lead to writing a memoir, Dinner for Vampires. \u0022I\u0027m not interested in a witch hunt, I didn\u0027t write this book to get revenge on anyone, I just wanted to tell an honest truth about what happened.\u0022\n\nSubscribe to People \u25BA\u25BA http://bit.ly/SubscribetoPeople \n\n*CONNECT*\nWeb: https://people.com \nFacebook: http://facebook.com/peoplemag \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/people \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/people/ \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@people\n\n*PEOPLE* remains the trusted authority at the center of pop culture.
