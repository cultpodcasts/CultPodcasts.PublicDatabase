      "description": "My guest today is Katy Morgan Davies, a woman born into the Workers\u0027 Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, a communist cult based in South London that enslaved her, indoctrinated her and kept her inside for the first 30 years of her life with no understanding or exposure to the outside world.\n\nHer father was Aravindan Balakrishnan; the despotic cult leader, and her mother Sian Davies, a brainwashed cult member. Though her parents, they told their daughter that she was a test tube baby with no mother, father or relatives.\n\nAccompanying us on the call is John Hales, a man Katy describes as her real father - who has life stories to tell in his own right.\n\nEquipped with a microphone, access to a friend\u0027s premium Zoom account and a lockdown laissez faire hairstyle; I sat down with a woman who is the embodiment of resilience and compassion. I hope you enjoy.\n\nKaty\u0027s book: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Caged-Bird-Katy-Morgan-Davies/dp/059307968X\n\nHarry\u0027s Twitter: https://twitter.com/RobboHarry\n\nOpening song: \u0027Two Minutes Forty-Three of Non-Euclidian Harmony\u0027 - Circus Marcus",
