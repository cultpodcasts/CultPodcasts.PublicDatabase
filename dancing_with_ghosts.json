      "description": "In this video I talk about the compelling music video made by Scientology in 1990 called \u0022We Stand Tall\u0022. The video was essentially a propaganda piece extolling the virtues and riches of the Church of Scientology, but when it leaked into the wog world it was essentially laughed out of existence.\n\nDancing with Ghosts (Music Only) Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-_Fp5xMRz6v9aLahw-tYQw\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n~~ Dancing with Ghosts on Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3p9Y7nx\n~~ My Podcast: https://bit.ly/2rLptoO\n~~ Dancing with Ghosts Merch: https://bit.ly/2QhiU71\n~~ Instagram: @DancingWithGhostsOfficial\n~~ Twitter: @DanceGhostDance\n~~ Dancing with Ghosts on Facebook: https://bit.ly/3cmyJB6\n------------------------------------------------------------\n#scientology #musicvideo #review",
