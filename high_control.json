      "description": "Ally shares her experiences of joining multiple high-control groups and the trauma she faced. She talks about her involvement with the United Pentecostal Church (UPC) and the strict standards and control imposed by the church. Despite initially joining with a passion for Jesus, Ally found herself conforming to the church\u0027s rules and regulations. Eventually, she and her church decided to leave the UPC. This episode highlights the harmful effects of high-control groups and the need to recognize and address them. Ally also highlights the connection between the white Charismatic prayer movement and white Christian nationalism, as well as the thought control and radicalization that can take place in those spaces. Ally encourages listeners to ask questions, deliver pushback, and prioritize their own safety and well-being. Questions? Comments? Ideas for the show?
