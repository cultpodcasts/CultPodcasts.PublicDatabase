      "description": "Mitch Brisker and Jeffrey Augustine discuss Scientology\u0027s bizarre 1996 Orientation film which all new members are required to watch. \n\nAfter watching the film, new Scientologists must sign a contract stating they have seen the film and agree that Scientology is a religion. \n\nThis is the first of four membership contracts all Scientologists must sign which systematically strip them of their civil and legal rights. \n\nSee Jeffrey Augustine\u0027s article on this and read the contracts for yourself: https://scientologymoneyproject.com/2016/12/14/dox-how-scientology-ensnares-the-unsuspecting-in-a-series-of-binding-contracts/\n\nIn the 1996 version, the film\u0027s narrator declared that you could join Scientology or walk away from it -- and if you chose to walk away you could also jump off a bridge or blow your brains out. \n\nL. Ron Hubbard scripted the 1996 film when he was alive. Typical of Hubbard\u0027s work, he created a false sense of danger in which Scientology or unaliving one\u0027s self were the only possible options. \n\nIn this video, Mitch shows a letter written to him by David Miscavige who praised the Orientation film as the greatest film ever made.",
