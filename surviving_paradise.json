How does Jesus make so many mistakes when choosing his guys to lead the congregation? Why does Jesus appoint men that have never read the bible or their own literature; that have family problems and like their booze? Or worse: commit crimes against children?! This former elder pulls back the curtain on the \u0027elder arrangement\u0027 and what really goes down in the B school!TWITTER: @exjwpodcastYouTube: Surviving ParadiseInstagram: survivingparadisepodcastTWITTER: @exjwpodcastINSTAGRAM: survivingparadisepodcast",

      "description": "Why would anyone want to leave the \u0027spiritual paradise\u0027 that is Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses? We are prepared to give you well over 144,000 reasons why overlapping generations aren\u0027t a thing, facial hair is normal, Smurfs aren\u0027t demonized ... and Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses are a cult. In our first episode we cover \u0027who is this guy? where did he come from? And why is he starting a podcast now?\u0027With each episode we will laugh, cry, talk old doctrine, the new \u0027religion\u0027 and what it was like to grow up in the 70\u0027s and 80\u0027s as a Jehovah\u0027s Witness. It\u0027s very likely we will stray into hard hitting subjects like the magic of the cheese danish, being a kid in a Kingdom Hall with no windows ... and how some of us went from teenagers chasing girls at District Conventions, to the elders that busted the next generation. Let\u0027s hang out ... heal, laugh, reminisce!\u00A0TWITTER: @exjwpodcastInstagram: @survivingparadisepodcastTWITTER: @exjwpodcastINSTAGRAM: survivingparadisepodcast",
