Schafer and his Royal Fraternity of Master Metaphysicians are definitely one of the strangest and least well known self help cults to be born out of the economic depression of the 1930\u0027s. They hit the headlines when they claimed to be raising a baby named Jean to be immortal -- she was to be reared on a diet of vegetarianism and positive thinking. She would be Miss Immortality, designed to live forever! But did you know that their experiment in immortality was actually inspired by none other than author of Think and Grow Rich, Napoleon Hill?\n\nJoin me as we dive deep into yet another strange cult tale from the early 20th century!\n\nSpecial thanks to Triskaidekapho13ic for helping source archive materials \u0026 creating an actual sources document for me.\n\nSOURCES \uD83D\uDCDC \nhttps://bit.ly/3noo68Y\n\nEnjoyed the video?

They were guided by the ascended masters - a group of spiritual advisors that Guy, Edna and their son Donald claimed to have direct contact with, including Jesus and St Germain.\n\nBut behind the brightly coloured charts and strangely aesthetically appealing artwork, lies a more sinister story, connecting this world of new age woo-woo directly to f*scists and right-wing ideology that\u0027s still very much present to this day.\n\nEnjoyed the video?

      "description": "Helena Blavatsky was the founder of the Theosophical Society and widely known as the Grandmother of the New Age. In this video, I dive into her life - from her aristocratic upbringing, to her years of travelling around the world, to controversy, her teachings and her legacy.\n\nThis is the first part in a forthcoming series on the New Age and UFO cults. It\u2019s important to understand Helena Blavatsky first, because she created so much of what we know as \u201Cnew age\u201D, and almost every group that we\u2019ll be talking about takes something from her. I am so excited to share this new series with you all. I\u0027ve been fascinated by new religious movements and cults for a long time, and I wanted to find a way to talk about them that doesn\u2019t feel exploitative. I think it\u2019s important to remember that inside all of these movements/cults is someone who has a family and people that love them, and often there are victims too.\n\nI know this video was quite historical, so let me know what you think in the comments. Also what do you think of the new filming set up? It feels more\u2026cosy? Idk. Sound off down below.\n\nAlso I feel like my explanation of \u0022Aryan\u0022 was incredibly brief and over simplified and I\u0027d urge you all to go and read this article.

      "description": "Today we\u0027re going to be diving deep into the disappearance of Shelly Miscavige and the Church of Scientology to find out what really happened - is Shelly Miscavige missing, or is she a prisoner of belief?\n\nI\u0027m truly fascinated with cults \u0026 religions and Scientology has been one of my favourite religious organisations to look into for a while now. I think I\u0027ve watched almost every documentary, from John Sweeney on the BBC, to Louis Theroux, Going Clear, Leah Remini\u0027s show and obviously the great journalism from Tony Ortega. I wanted to talk about Shelly Miscavige on here for a while because, from the outside, it seems like a terrifying mystery...the first lady of Scientology that went missing. However, when you dig into it, you find - in my opinion - an even more terrifying story of coercive control and years of religious indoctrination -- ALLEGEDLY.\n\nAnyway, I hope you enjoy this video and I definitely have a lot more videos on cults \u0026 religious organisations coming up.
