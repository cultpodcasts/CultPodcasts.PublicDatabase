      "description": "CORT 2023: Dr. Danielle Kramer\nToxic Purity: Unpacking the Patriarchy: Understanding the Foundations of Gender Oppression in Religion and Beyond\n\nHave you ever felt like you were taught conflicting messages about men and women? Men are protectors of women and society\u2026who are visual creatures with uncontrollable lust leaving them unable to stop themselves. Women are the pure, innocent, caring nurturers who need men to guide them\u2026 and also responsible for the fall of man, now capable of being stumbling blocks and potential seductresses. Join Dr. Kramer in this enlightening discussion as we delve deep into the intricate web of gender oppression. Dr. Kramer will navigate the nuanced terrain of ambivalent sexism, dissecting its manifestations in both benevolent and hostile forms, and shed light on how these attitudes perpetuate systemic gender inequalities in religion and society. Moreover, attendees will gain insight into the intricate connection between ambivalent sexism and purity culture within Christianity, illuminating how religious ideologies intersect with patriarchal structures to reinforce gender bias and uphold male hierarchies. Prepare to challenge preconceptions and engage in a thought-provoking discussion on the enduring foundations of gender oppression in our society.\n\nDr. Danielle Kramer (she/they) is a certified sex therapist and board-certified clinical sexologist who splits their time between clinical practice, research, consulting. In clinical practice Dr. Kramer specializes in the care of LGBTQ\u002B folks and women\u2019s/AFAB (assigned female at birth) folks. Dr. Kramer was raised in purity culture and devotes a significant amount of their practice to working with religious and sexual trauma, as well as being the only certified sex therapist in the Florida Panhandle providing gender affirming care. In research Dr. Kramer focuses on misogyny in the US, abortion care and access, and AFAB sexual health. Dr. Kramer also consults on the local, state, and federal level on the politics and policy of abortion care and access. Dr. Kramer is a member of American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors, and Therapists (ASSECT); The American Alternative Sexualities Health Research Alliance (TASHRA); and the Sexual Health Alliance.\n\nMore about CORT: https://www.religioustraumaconference.org\n\nWhen you Support this channel by joining our YouTube membership (starting as low as $3/month) you\u0027ll get early access to all of our new content, access to badges and special chat emojis and more.

At age 14, he was kidnapped and trafficked to the USA to perform labour in the Sea Org branch of Scientology.

On returning to Vancouver, he spent about 10 more years on staff at the church of Scientology. \n\nIn 2012, Jeff woke up - and he has been working on his recovery ever since.

      "description": "Shameless Sexuality: David Teachout -The Continuing Religious Trauma of Demands for Purity \n\nDavid Teachout\nMental Health Therapist and Coach, Life Weavings, LLC\n\nIn this talk we\u2019ll discuss human sexuality, its foundation for human relationships, and how to work through the potential trauma that purity culture perpetuates. The most insidious quality of many religious traditions is a belief in the inherent absence of good in people apart from a connection to deity. Often referred to as \u2018sin,\u2019 it is a way of looking at the very nature of our humanity and seeing something rotten, or set apart from what is good and pure. When this is centered on a basic trait like sexuality, a primary way of reflecting on ourselves and how we relate to others becomes cause for shame, malignant self-doubt, and anxiety. \n\nDavid Teachout is a mental health therapist, coach, and photographer focused on teaching how creativity intersects with mental flexibility in working through the inevitable difficulties in life. David grew up as a Christian fundamentalist, attending a bible college and receiving a bachelor\u2019s in theology and psychology. During his studies there, David deconverted and has been on a journey of more deeply appreciating the many nuances of humanity ever since. David has a master\u2019s in both forensic psychology and counseling psychology, and is currently at work on a doctorate in clinical psychology. David has been actively working within the field of psychology as therapist, social worker, advocate, and subject-matter-expert, for over fifteen years. In his spare time, David enjoys reading a copious amount, both fiction and non-fiction, exploring perspective through photography, and maintains a blog at www.lifeweavings.com and a podcast at www.humanitysvalues.com\n\nSupport this channel by becoming a Member of the CORT YouTube channel.\nWhen you Support this channel by joining our YouTube membership (starting as low as $3/month) you\u0027ll get early access to all of our new content, access to badges and special chat emojis, and more.

Relationships of any kind are how we project the meaning we\u2019re creating for our lives and direct the expression of our Values. Like a roadmap and its connection to actual travel, Values need structure to be guided towards realized behavior. For those in a relationship where one or another is religious and the other is non-religious or formerly religious, those structures can lead to misunderstandings, hurt, and unhealthy relationship dynamics.\n\nDavid Teachout is a mental health therapist, coach, and photographer focused on teaching how creativity intersects with mental flexibility in working through the inevitable difficulties in life. David grew up as a Christian fundamentalist, attending a bible college and receiving a bachelor\u2019s in theology and psychology. During his studies there, David deconverted and has been on a journey of more deeply appreciating the many nuances of humanity ever since. David has a master\u2019s in both forensic psychology and counseling psychology, and is currently at work on a doctorate in clinical psychology. David has been actively working within the field of psychology as therapist, social worker, advocate, and subject-matter-expert, for over fifteen years.

      "description": "Shameless Sexuality: Anthony Venn Brown - A Life of Unlearning \u2013 From Gay Shame to Gay Pride\n\nPeople often say I don\u2019t understand gay pride. I say that\u2019s because you\u2019ve never experienced gay shame. The awakening of sexuality for the heterosexual young person is often a time of exploration and discovery. For the young gay person, awareness of their orientation brings with it fear. Fear of what others will think. Fear of how they will react. Will I be accepted or rejected? Will I go to hell? Within the Christian world, those fears are compounded with shame. You\u2019ve heard nothing positive about being gay or gay people. Perverted, evil, sick, destroyers of all that is good in the world, abominations. And so the secret internal struggle between \u201Cgood\u201D and \u201Cevil\u201D begins, building an identity of self-hatred and self-loathing. Before the truth can set you free you need to understand the lie that kept you enslaved.\n\nAnthony Venn Brown\n\nAmbassadors \u0026 Bridge Builders International is committed to ending the unnecessary suffering caused by ignorance and misinformation about sexual orientation and gender identity. Our mission is to create understanding, acceptance and a better world for LGBTIQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual. transgender, intersex, queer) people. \n\nSupport Janice on Patreon (starting as low as $2/month) and get access to bonus content: https://www.patreon.com/janiceselbie Thanks to my newest patrons: Marie, Mary, and Peter.

Drawing on a combination of personal experience and my expertise as a therapist, in this talk I\u0027ll explore the various factors that keep people in religiously conservative groups from exploring and identifying their own identities and orientations.\n\nRebecca is a skilled and compassionate therapist who also has a sense of humor. She says that one of her therapy superpowers is to help families and couples connect across the religious-secular divide. You can see her in action in this presentation to formerly religious people about how to maintain good relationships with their faithful family and friends.\n\nSupport Janice on Patreon (starting as low as $2/month) and get access to bonus content: https://www.patreon.com/janiceselbie Thanks to my newest patrons: Marie, Mary, and Peter.

For some people, it is never safe to use psychedelics. Use of psychedelics is not legal in many states and countries.\n\nMARIE Le PAGE describes herself as a life doula, life coach, community organizer, and plant-medicine sitter. Marie understands personally the pain and trauma of growing up in an emotionally neglectful and spiritually abusive household. Upon discovering plant medicine, Marie started their awakening and integration experience. They now find joy in coaching others who are also awakening, whether it\u2019s processing their spiritual abuse, their journeys into non-traditional relationship structures, or any other deconstruction and healing path.\n\nMarie recently spoke at the Shameless Sexuality: Life After Purity Culture online conference about remedial consent for former fundies and hosted the More Than Monogamy Panel, of which I was a member.

If we\u2019re lucky, we grow up in an environment where the adults around us encourage and foster that creativity.\n\nHowever, for many people who have experienced high-demand religions, their creativity was diminished or outright discouraged. \n\nReclaiming our creativity is a way to express what we experienced, sometimes before we have the linguistic faculties to speak about it, because many of us understand our experiences on a sensory level that supersedes language.\n\nBy using art to tell our stories we begin to take control of them, rewriting the narratives that our abusers had manipulated for so long.\n\nIn this session participants will learn several art exercises that they can use to deepen their own artistic practices, and the science behind how and why they work.\n\nMore about CORT: https://www.religioustraumaconference.org\n\nSupport the founder of CORT, Janice Selbie on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/janiceselbie\n\nFrom the creators of the Conference on Religious Trauma comes the Shameless Sexuality Conference: a conference dedicated to life after purity culture. \n\nGet your tickets to the upcoming Shameless Sexuality: https://www.shamelesssexuality.org/\n\nGrab your CORT merch here: \nhttps://www.divorcing-religion.com/conference-on-religious-trauma\n\nIf you are struggling with the symptoms of Religious Trauma Syndrome, sign up for the Divorcing Religion Workshop or one-on-one counseling with Janice Selbie, the founder of CORT: \nhttps://www.divorcing-religion.com\n\nFollow CORT on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ComeToCORT\nFollow CORT on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ConferenceOnReligiousTrauma\nFollow Janice Selbie on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Wise_counsellor\n\nMusic: \nhttps://www.bensound.com\n\nVideo by \nhttps://www.porthosmedia.net",

      "description": "I\u2019m Dave Warnock, a former conservative Evangelical pastor and church leader for almost 40 years. About ten years ago, I began a process of examining and investigating the faith claims of Evangelical Christianity- for the first time in my life...and came to the conclusion that the faith I had given my life to was something I could no longer embrace. At first calling myself an agnostic, in the last few years I have purposefully begun to embrace the word \u2018Atheist\u2019. In so doing, I\u2019m doing what I can to de-stigmatize this word (which simply means \u201Cnon-theist\u201D) and seeking to show that atheists can be good people- exhibiting the same morals and values as people of faith.\n\nMy exit from Christianity was basically due to the tenants of my life-long faith no longer aligning with my core beliefs of toleration and acceptance of all people, and my belief that life is to be lived for the moments that are contained within this one life we know we have; rather than viewing this life as a \u201Ctemporary\u201D life until we enter eternity. Turning my back on this faith came at huge personal cost- with the loss of almost my entire community of friends, the end of my 37 year marriage, and the loss of relationship with two of my three children, which has also deprived me of being a part of my six grandchildren\u2019s lives to this day.\n\nAs we know, life is random, chaotic, and unpredictable; and it\u2019s no different for me. On February 26, 2019, I received the devastating diagnosis of ALS (Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease). A series of doctor visits, a blood test, MRI, more doctor visits, and finally an EMG at one of the most prestigious hospitals in the country was followed by the cold and clinically fatal diagnosis - along with instructions to put my clothes back on and where to find the elevator outside the exit from the neurologist\u2019s office. No follow-up plan\u2026no counselor referral\u2026just to go home and die in 3-5 years.\n\nSuddenly for me this precious and brief life became infinitely more precious and incredibly brief. Instead of succumbing to the depression, anger, and hopelessness this debilitating fatal diagnosis often brings, I immediately decided to begin \u201CDying Out Loud,\u201D - living life to the fullest and making plans to travel as much of the world as my body will allow. I wanted to see places to which I\u2019d never been and spend time with people I know and love, while also experiencing the joy of meeting new people and cherishing the beautiful \u201Cmoments\u201D life offers all of us. This life-change soon morphed into what is now known as the Dying Out Loud tour; wherein I am traveling to speak at venues all over the country (actually, the world), doing interviews on podcasts and YouTube shows, and basically spreading my message anywhere I can.\n\nFollow my adventure on social media as I seek to grab as many moments as I can. You can send a message on social media to schedule time with me if I\u0027ll be in your area. Or if you would like for me to come speak to your group about my life with and without Christianity, \u0022Dying Out Loud\u0022, facing death as an atheist, and on Dying with Dignity, (among other topics) please reach out to us to schedule something.
