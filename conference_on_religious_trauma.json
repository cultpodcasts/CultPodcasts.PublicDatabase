Willie is a professional person, having received a B.S Degree in Finance and earned an Executive MBA.Though he and his wife now own several successful businesses, Willie and his sister were raised by a single mother in the public housing neighbourhoods of Birmingham, Alabama.\n\nAs a child, he was relentlessly bullied due to his thick glasses and stutter. His stepfather was so verbally abusive that Willie threatened to kill him.Raised in a strict Christian household deep in the Bible belt, Willie walked away from organized religion and Christianity in 2015.\n\nAfter doing exhaustive research on the topic, he wrote his most recent book: From Saved to Sane: My journey away from Christianity and how it has adversely affected the African American Community. Today, Willie shares about the impact his deconversion had on family relationships and why he is so passionate about educating on religion and critical thinking.\n\nGet your tickets to the Conference on Religious Trauma: https://www.religioustraumaconference.org/\n\nFIND WILLIE CARTWRIGHT\nhttps://www.williecartwrightspeaks.com/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCktoA5hQZBI03PIQAOoS2nQ\nhttps://www.facebook.com/WillieCartwrightSpeaks/?fref=ts\nhttps://twitter.com/wocartwright\n\nRESOURCES MENTIONED\nDr. Darrel Ray at CORT2021 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgclZY5X6B4 \nJeremiah Camara http://jeremiahcamara.com/\nMandisa Thomas https://blacknonbelievers.org/\nCandace Gorham https://twitter.com/ebonyexodus\nhttps://www.seculartherapy.org/\nhttps://www.shamelesssexuality.org/\n\nFollow Janice and the Conference on Religious Trauma on Social Media: \nMastodon: JaniceSelbie@mas.to\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/divorcereligion\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Wise_counsellor\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ComeToCORT\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/janice.selbie\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DivorcingReligion\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ConferenceOnReligiousTrauma\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@janiceselbie\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/wisecounsellor/\n\nThe Divorcing Religion Podcast is for entertainment purposes only.

If we\u2019re lucky, we grow up in an environment where the adults around us encourage and foster that creativity.\n\nHowever, for many people who have experienced high-demand religions, their creativity was diminished or outright discouraged. \n\nReclaiming our creativity is a way to express what we experienced, sometimes before we have the linguistic faculties to speak about it, because many of us understand our experiences on a sensory level that supersedes language.\n\nBy using art to tell our stories we begin to take control of them, rewriting the narratives that our abusers had manipulated for so long.\n\nIn this session participants will learn several art exercises that they can use to deepen their own artistic practices, and the science behind how and why they work.\n\nMore about CORT: https://www.religioustraumaconference.org\n\nSupport the founder of CORT, Janice Selbie on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/janiceselbie\n\nFrom the creators of the Conference on Religious Trauma comes the Shameless Sexuality Conference: a conference dedicated to life after purity culture. \n\nGet your tickets to the upcoming Shameless Sexuality: https://www.shamelesssexuality.org/\n\nGrab your CORT merch here: \nhttps://www.divorcing-religion.com/conference-on-religious-trauma\n\nIf you are struggling with the symptoms of Religious Trauma Syndrome, sign up for the Divorcing Religion Workshop or one-on-one counseling with Janice Selbie, the founder of CORT: \nhttps://www.divorcing-religion.com\n\nFollow CORT on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ComeToCORT\nFollow CORT on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ConferenceOnReligiousTrauma\nFollow Janice Selbie on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Wise_counsellor\n\nMusic: \nhttps://www.bensound.com\n\nVideo by \nhttps://www.porthosmedia.net",

      "title": "CORT 2021: Dave Warnock - Dying Out Loud",
      "description": "I\u2019m Dave Warnock, a former conservative Evangelical pastor and church leader for almost 40 years. About ten years ago, I began a process of examining and investigating the faith claims of Evangelical Christianity- for the first time in my life...and came to the conclusion that the faith I had given my life to was something I could no longer embrace. At first calling myself an agnostic, in the last few years I have purposefully begun to embrace the word \u2018Atheist\u2019. In so doing, I\u2019m doing what I can to de-stigmatize this word (which simply means \u201Cnon-theist\u201D) and seeking to show that atheists can be good people- exhibiting the same morals and values as people of faith.\n\nMy exit from Christianity was basically due to the tenants of my life-long faith no longer aligning with my core beliefs of toleration and acceptance of all people, and my belief that life is to be lived for the moments that are contained within this one life we know we have; rather than viewing this life as a \u201Ctemporary\u201D life until we enter eternity. Turning my back on this faith came at huge personal cost- with the loss of almost my entire community of friends, the end of my 37 year marriage, and the loss of relationship with two of my three children, which has also deprived me of being a part of my six grandchildren\u2019s lives to this day.\n\nAs we know, life is random, chaotic, and unpredictable; and it\u2019s no different for me. On February 26, 2019, I received the devastating diagnosis of ALS (Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease). A series of doctor visits, a blood test, MRI, more doctor visits, and finally an EMG at one of the most prestigious hospitals in the country was followed by the cold and clinically fatal diagnosis - along with instructions to put my clothes back on and where to find the elevator outside the exit from the neurologist\u2019s office. No follow-up plan\u2026no counselor referral\u2026just to go home and die in 3-5 years.\n\nSuddenly for me this precious and brief life became infinitely more precious and incredibly brief. Instead of succumbing to the depression, anger, and hopelessness this debilitating fatal diagnosis often brings, I immediately decided to begin \u201CDying Out Loud,\u201D - living life to the fullest and making plans to travel as much of the world as my body will allow. I wanted to see places to which I\u2019d never been and spend time with people I know and love, while also experiencing the joy of meeting new people and cherishing the beautiful \u201Cmoments\u201D life offers all of us. This life-change soon morphed into what is now known as the Dying Out Loud tour; wherein I am traveling to speak at venues all over the country (actually, the world), doing interviews on podcasts and YouTube shows, and basically spreading my message anywhere I can.\n\nFollow my adventure on social media as I seek to grab as many moments as I can. You can send a message on social media to schedule time with me if I\u0027ll be in your area. Or if you would like for me to come speak to your group about my life with and without Christianity, \u0022Dying Out Loud\u0022, facing death as an atheist, and on Dying with Dignity, (among other topics) please reach out to us to schedule something.
