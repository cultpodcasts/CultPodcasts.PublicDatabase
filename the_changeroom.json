      "title": "Black Resilience in White Supremacist Culture with Nya Daley",
      "description": "As the incredibly insightful Nya Daley points out very succinctly in this interview, if you didn\u2019t notice a difference in the way that Black people were treated in most studios in North America (and maybe beyond) after the summer of 2020, then you really weren\u2019t paying attention. In this episode, Nya skillfully unpacks the position of Black movement and meditation teachers in studios and paths to creating the right opportunities for all teachers and practitioners. Nya Daley is an Atlanta, Georgia based social worker, community builder, yoga teacher and equity, diversity and belongingness educator, equipped with over 15 years of experience working in the wellness and social service sectors. Nya is the founder and lead facilitator of Soulga Yoga, a wellness collective that is rooted in empowering, highlighting and supporting BBIMP* wellness professionals by facilitating accessible and culturally relevant movement, mentorship and educational offerings. https://www.soulgawellness.com/",

      "description": "The Cult of Personality shows up all OVAH the place from politics to celebrity to\u2026wellness spaces. Taryn Diamond digs into the pitfalls of centering practice spaces around the celebrity of one charismatic leader and the cult-like drama that ensues. Taryn is just as smart as she is hilarious which is why we made this one a two-part episode. Taryn Diamond is an energetic and inclusive instructor, drawing from experience in facilitation, gender analysis, and a commitment to social justice. Her entry to yoga was through movement, but her passion ruminates in studying its roots in Eastern philosophy. She is unabashed in her commitment to cheesy jokes and not taking this thing called \u0027life\u0027 too seriously.
