      "description": "The Cult of Personality shows up all OVAH the place from politics to celebrity to\u2026wellness spaces. Taryn Diamond digs into the pitfalls of centering practice spaces around the celebrity of one charismatic leader and the cult-like drama that ensues. Taryn is just as smart as she is hilarious which is why we made this one a two-part episode. Taryn Diamond is an energetic and inclusive instructor, drawing from experience in facilitation, gender analysis, and a commitment to social justice. Her entry to yoga was through movement, but her passion ruminates in studying its roots in Eastern philosophy. She is unabashed in her commitment to cheesy jokes and not taking this thing called \u0027life\u0027 too seriously. Taryn is most passionate about teaching movement that breeds self-inquiry and compassion. https://www.taryndiamond.com/",
