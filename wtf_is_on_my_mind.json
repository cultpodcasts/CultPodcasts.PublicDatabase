      "description": "In this Episode: Guy Pearce talks about why he reached out to me. We had an amazing, deep, and honest conversation covering cults, groups, his fascination with The Vow, and his take on acting and being human.Guy Pearce was born October 5, 1967 in the UK to Margaret Anne and Stuart Graham Pearce. His father was born in Auckland, New Zealand, to English and Scottish parents, while Guy\u0027s mother is English. Pearce and his family initially traveled to Australia for two years, after his father was offered the position of Chief test pilot for the Australian Government. Guy was just 3-years-old. After deciding to stay in Australia and settling in the Victorian city of Geelong, Guy\u0027s father was killed 5 years later in an aircraft test flight, leaving Guy\u0027s mother, a schoolteacher, to care for him and his older sister, Tracy.Having little interest in subjects at school like math or science, Guy favored art, drama and music. He joined local theatre groups at a young age and appeared in such productions as \u0022The King and I,\u0022 \u0022Fiddler on the Roof,\u0022 and \u0022The Wizard of Oz.\u0022 In 1985, just two days after his final high school exam, Guy started a four-year stint as \u0022Mike Young\u0022 on the popular Aussie soap Neighbours (1985). At age 20, Guy appeared in his first film, Heaven Tonight (1989), then, after a string of appearances in film, television and on the stage, he won the role of an outrageous drag queen in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (1994).He has amazed film critics and audiences, alike, with his magnificent performances in L.A. Confidential (1997), Memento (2000), The Proposition (2005), Factory Girl (2006), The Hurt Locker (2008), The King\u0027s Speech (2010) and the HBO mini-series, Mildred Pierce (2011). Next to acting, Guy has had a life-long passion for music and songwriting.Support the showWebsite: www.markvicente.comInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/markvicente/Twitter: https://twitter.com/markvicenteFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/markvicente/Theme Music: \u0022In Time\u0022 by Kollen",

I sent it mostly to lower ranks because I knew that if I included the top of the organization, the higher ranks would have blocked it.

As I said, that is 0.5%. I am well aware that this LONG letter may not move any of you. Too many EM\u2019s and The Knife. Also, some of you may be True Believers. But at least we can collectively never look back and say I didn\u2019t express this. That I didn\u2019t try. I am writing this hopefully to your future selves who will look back at this, maybe years from now and say HOLY SHIT! It was right in front of me!\u00A0 More and more information will be disclosed that will startle many of you. At first you will be convinced it is all part of the big bad conspiracy against your beloved Lord and Master and his \u0027innocent\u2019 minions. But the revelations will grow and grow and be more and more shocking. Then you will have to face the horror as well, as many of us have. It will take significant decompression and time. We will be here when that day comes. We will help you.\u00A0You may never talk to me as long as you live, and you likely won\u2019t, but do ONE thing. Read ONE book:\u00A0\u0022Take Back Your Life: Recovering from Cults and Abusive Relationships\u0022\u00A0By Janja Lalich and Madeleine Landau Tobias\u00A0It will change your life.

I am nevertheless aghast at the level of contempt for women and cruelty toward women that is at the rotten core of this group. Raniere succeeds in fulfilling his sadistic need to enslave others through a kind of battering, his twisted rationales convincing followers, and not just the women, that self-torture and torture of others builds character.\u00A0 In fact, what he does is utterly self-serving, exploiting others entirely to feed the delusion of his own omnipotence.

In the tradition of the landmark book Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism by Ch\u00F6gyam Trungpa, Spiritual Bypassing casts a lucidly critical eye on our deeply entrenched misuse of spirituality, furthering the body of psychological/spiritual insight into how we use (and abuse) spirituality. https://www.robertmasters.com/book/spiritual-bypassing/Robert Augustus Masters: Clarifying My PastFrom 1986 to 1994 I led an experimental psychospiritual community that gradually became a cult. I called myself its guide but was more its director and centerpiece. More often than I\u2019d like to admit, I was arrogant, aggressive, and misused my power, and those in the community paid the price for this.
