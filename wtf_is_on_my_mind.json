      "description": "In this Episode: Guy Pearce talks about why he reached out to me. We had an amazing, deep, and honest conversation covering cults, groups, his fascination with The Vow, and his take on acting and being human.Guy Pearce was born October 5, 1967 in the UK to Margaret Anne and Stuart Graham Pearce. His father was born in Auckland, New Zealand, to English and Scottish parents, while Guy\u0027s mother is English. Pearce and his family initially traveled to Australia for two years, after his father was offered the position of Chief test pilot for the Australian Government. Guy was just 3-years-old. After deciding to stay in Australia and settling in the Victorian city of Geelong, Guy\u0027s father was killed 5 years later in an aircraft test flight, leaving Guy\u0027s mother, a schoolteacher, to care for him and his older sister, Tracy.Having little interest in subjects at school like math or science, Guy favored art, drama and music. He joined local theatre groups at a young age and appeared in such productions as \u0022The King and I,\u0022 \u0022Fiddler on the Roof,\u0022 and \u0022The Wizard of Oz.\u0022 In 1985, just two days after his final high school exam, Guy started a four-year stint as \u0022Mike Young\u0022 on the popular Aussie soap Neighbours (1985). At age 20, Guy appeared in his first film, Heaven Tonight (1989), then, after a string of appearances in film, television and on the stage, he won the role of an outrageous drag queen in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (1994).He has amazed film critics and audiences, alike, with his magnificent performances in L.A. Confidential (1997), Memento (2000), The Proposition (2005), Factory Girl (2006), The Hurt Locker (2008), The King\u0027s Speech (2010) and the HBO mini-series, Mildred Pierce (2011). Next to acting, Guy has had a life-long passion for music and songwriting.Support the showWebsite: www.markvicente.comInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/markvicente/Twitter: https://twitter.com/markvicenteFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/markvicente/Theme Music: \u0022In Time\u0022 by Kollen",

Along with my fellow whistleblowers, we had spent the previous 9 months trying to get people out of NXIVM. I made one final attempt en masse to get my friends (true believers) to wake up before Raniere was arrested. I wrote a long letter to a select few friends on \u2018the inside\u2019 on March 10th, 2018 - 16 days before Keith Raniere was arrested in a Mexican Villa on March 26th, 2018. I sent it mostly to lower ranks because I knew that if I included the top of the organization, the higher ranks would have blocked it. I needed my friends who received the letter to have time to absorb what I was saying before they had to report it up the chain of command. This was my desperate attempt to try and wake my friends up before the arrests began. ~ Mark Vicente\u00A0Sections of the letter: Shunning, Whistleblower, The Blame Game, The Appearance of Calm, VWEEK2016, Slavery.

As I said, that is 0.5%. I am well aware that this LONG letter may not move any of you. Too many EM\u2019s and The Knife. Also, some of you may be True Believers. But at least we can collectively never look back and say I didn\u2019t express this. That I didn\u2019t try. I am writing this hopefully to your future selves who will look back at this, maybe years from now and say HOLY SHIT! It was right in front of me!\u00A0 More and more information will be disclosed that will startle many of you. At first you will be convinced it is all part of the big bad conspiracy against your beloved Lord and Master and his \u0027innocent\u2019 minions. But the revelations will grow and grow and be more and more shocking. Then you will have to face the horror as well, as many of us have. It will take significant decompression and time. We will be here when that day comes. We will help you.\u00A0You may never talk to me as long as you live, and you likely won\u2019t, but do ONE thing. Read ONE book:\u00A0\u0022Take Back Your Life: Recovering from Cults and Abusive Relationships\u0022\u00A0By Janja Lalich and Madeleine Landau Tobias\u00A0It will change your life.

I am nevertheless aghast at the level of contempt for women and cruelty toward women that is at the rotten core of this group. Raniere succeeds in fulfilling his sadistic need to enslave others through a kind of battering, his twisted rationales convincing followers, and not just the women, that self-torture and torture of others builds character.\u00A0 In fact, what he does is utterly self-serving, exploiting others entirely to feed the delusion of his own omnipotence. Those who have been brainwashed with Raniere\u0027s hateful ideas about women will need time to free themselves from their conditioning, to be able to respect and trust themselves again.\u0022\u00A0 ~ Daniel Shaw, LCSWSupport the showWebsite: www.markvicente.comInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/markvicente/Twitter: https://twitter.com/markvicenteFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/markvicente/Theme Music: \u0022In Time\u0022 by Kollen",

      "description": "In this Episode: (PART 1 of 4)\u00A0In March 2018 I recognized Keith Raniere was about to be arrested. Along with my fellow whistleblowers, we had spent the previous 9 months trying to get people out of NXIVM. I made one final attempt en masse to get my friends (true believers) to wake up before Raniere was arrested. I wrote a long letter to a select few friends on \u2018the inside\u2019 on March 10th, 2018 - 16 days before Keith Raniere was arrested in a Mexican Villa on March 26th, 2018. I sent it mostly to lower ranks because I knew that if I included the top of the organization, the higher ranks would have blocked it. I needed my friends who received the letter to have time to absorb what I was saying before they had to report it up the chain of command. This was my desperate attempt to try and wake my friends up before the arrests began. ~ Mark Vicente\u00A0Sections of the letter: Grab a glass of wine, An Unspoken Credo, The Illuminati, Pam\u2019s Death, Sudden Disappearance?, Multiple Attempts\u00A0I began my\u00A0 \u0022Whistleblower Blog\u0027 on my website a few days before the New York Times broke the explosive article on October 17th, 2017 (Exactly 5 years before \u0027The VOW - Part II airs on HBO) It was my attempt to leave breadcrumbs for my friends who were trying to figure out what was going on.\u00A0These are the links to the blog I referenced in the letter:(Read my blog starting on Episode 1 to understand \u2018word-salad\u2019) Episode 1 \u0026 2 below:\u00A0http://www.markvicente.com/whistleblower/2017/10/12/how-the-bleep-did-that-happen-episode-1\u00A0http://www.markvicente.com/whistleblower/2017/10/17/how-the-bleep-did-that-happen-episode-2 I didn\u2019t realize at the time I was caught in what I now understand as \u0027Stage 7\u0027.\u00A0 You can read about it on my blog:\u00A0http://www.markvicente.com/whistleblower/2017/10/24/how-the-bleep-did-that-happen-episode-9\u00A0\u0022At this stage, some people try to reason with the leaders. They will either arrange for visits or write long agonizing letters. Some hope that they can change the system or get some to agree with them. They are AMAZED at the total inability of leaders to hear what they are saying. However, some will agree with their arguments, pat them on the head and try to smooth their ruffled feelings.\u0022\u00A0Support the showWebsite: www.markvicente.comInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/markvicente/Twitter: https://twitter.com/markvicenteFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/markvicente/Theme Music: \u0022In Time\u0022 by Kollen",

Robert Augustus Masters write a book on Spiritual Bypassing, then abused his students. Toxic positivity protects abusers. The inability to acknowledge darkness. Teachers who haven\u0027t dealt with their psychological shit. Creating a kind of hell for yourself because you\u0027re not allowed to feel human. No compassion for self or others. Magically changing timelines to another reality? The only way \u0027out\u0027 is in. At \u0027Rock Bottom\u0027 you can\u0027t pretend anymore.\u00A0Spiritual Bypassing: When Spirituality Disconnects Us From What Really MattersSpiritual bypassing\u2014the use of spiritual practices/beliefs to avoid dealing with painful feelings, unresolved wounds, and developmental needs\u2014is so pervasive that it goes largely unnoticed. In the tradition of the landmark book Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism by Ch\u00F6gyam Trungpa, Spiritual Bypassing casts a lucidly critical eye on our deeply entrenched misuse of spirituality, furthering the body of psychological/spiritual insight into how we use (and abuse) spirituality. https://www.robertmasters.com/book/spiritual-bypassing/Robert Augustus Masters: Clarifying My PastFrom 1986 to 1994 I led an experimental psychospiritual community that gradually became a cult. I called myself its guide but was more its director and centerpiece. More often than I\u2019d like to admit, I was arrogant, aggressive, and misused my power, and those in the community paid the price for this. Everyone was caught up in my dream of a new kind of tribalism. https://www.robertmasters.com/about-robert/robert-augustus-masters-clarifying-my-past/Spiritual bypassing, Christian bypassing, Stoic bypassing https://www.philosophyforlife.org/blog/spiritual-bypassing-christian-bypassing-stoic-bypassingSupport the showWebsite: www.markvicente.comInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/markvicente/Twitter: https://twitter.com/markvicenteFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/markvicente/Theme Music: \u0022In Time\u0022 by Kollen",
