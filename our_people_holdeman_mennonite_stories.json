      "description": "In this episode of Our People: Holdeman Mennonite Stories, host Amanda sits down with Carolyn, who shares her deeply personal journey of growing up and living within the Holdeman Mennonite community. Carolyn\u2019s story is one of resilience, especially as she navigates the complexities of being a woman and a single mother in a patriarchal and high-control religious system. Carolyn begins by reflecting on her early years in Crooked Creek, where the church\u0027s teachings and sense of community provided her with a foundation. However, as she matured, she became increasingly aware of the strict roles imposed on women within the church. The expectations were clear: women were to be obedient, submissive and focused on homemaking and child-rearing. Carolyn describes the immense pressure to conform to these roles, which left little room for personal growth or autonomy. As a single mother, Carolyn faced additional scrutiny and judgment from the church staff and the broader community. She recounts how her status as a single mother was often viewed with suspicion, as though it signified a failure to adhere to the church\u2019s standards of marriage and family life. The lack of support for single mothers within the church only exacerbated the challenges she faced, leaving her to navigate motherhood largely on her own while still trying to meet the church\u2019s demanding expectations. Carolyn also speaks candidly about her interactions with church and school staff, who often reinforced patriarchal norms that kept women like her in subservient positions. She shares instances where she felt marginalized and disempowered by the male-dominated leadership, who were more interested in maintaining control than offering compassion or understanding. The episode takes a significant turn as Carolyn questions the roles and expectations placed upon her. She reflects on the moment she recognized that her worth was not defined by the church\u2019s patriarchal standards but by her strength and values. This realization became a catalyst for her decision to leave the church and pursue a life where she could be true to herself and her children, free from the oppressive structures that had once held her back. Carolyn\u2019s journey is not just one of breaking free from a controlling religious environment but also a story of reclaiming her identity as a woman and a mother. Despite the emotional and societal challenges, she emerges with a profound sense of self-worth and a determination to provide a better life for herself and her children, outside the confines of the church\u2019s rigid doctrines. This episode offers a deeply moving exploration of the intersection between gender, religion, and personal freedom. Carolyn\u2019s story sheds light on the unique struggles faced by women and single mothers in high-control religious groups and underscores the courage it takes to defy patriarchal norms and forge a path of independence. Her testimony is a powerful reminder of the importance of self-empowerment and the strength that comes from breaking free of oppressive systems.

      "description": "In this episode of \u0022Our People: Holdeman Mennonite Stories,\u0022 Teran Rinehart shares the story of her life, focusing on her challenging experiences growing up in the Carson City, Michigan congregation of Church of God in Christ Mennonite and its school. Teran begins by recounting the remarkable story of her grandmother, who was born into a wealthy family in Santiago, Chile, but left it all behind to become a mail-order bride in Michigan. Yolanda\u0027s journey into the Mennonite community had a lasting impact on her family, including Teran. As Teran reflects on her upbringing, she opens up about the hardships she faced in the Holdeman church school. Teran describes how she was not well-liked and often felt miserable, struggling to make friends. The school environment was particularly difficult for her as a queer, autistic child, and she endured frequent bullying. Despite her intelligence, Teran found herself in a classroom where she was the oldest and often felt smarter than both her classmates and her teachers. She candidly discusses the inadequacies of the Mennonite teachers, many of whom only had an eighth-grade education and were more focused on finding a husband than on teaching. Teran\u0027s experiences were further compounded by the lack of support from the school staff, who failed to address the bullying she faced. She shares a particularly painful memory of a teacher dismissing her after she reported being physically abused at home, illustrating the broader issue of Mennonite teachers not complying with their legal obligations as mandatory reporters. The constant bullying and lack of support left Teran feeling like the laughingstock of the school, and these experiences had a lasting impact on her. Despite these challenges, Teran found solace in teaching Bible school, which became one of her biggest passions. She reflects on her attempts to be a \u0022good Mennonite,\u0022 actively participating in Sunday school and trying her best to fit in, even as she struggled with the rigid expectations of the church. This episode offers an honest and poignant look at the difficulties of growing up in the Holdeman Mennonite church, particularly within its educational system. Teran\u2019s story sheds light on the emotional toll of being a child in an environment where conformity was prized over individuality, and where support was often lacking. Her experiences provide a valuable perspective on the challenges faced by those who didn\u2019t fit the mold in a strict religious community, making this episode a powerful and eye-opening listen.

      "description": "In this episode of \u0022Our People: Holdeman Mennonite Stories,\u0022 we had the pleasure of sitting down with Wes Friesen from the Barron, Wisconsin congregation of Church of God in Christ Mennonite. Wes takes us on a journey through his life, sharing intimate and heartfelt stories about his upbringing, experiences within the church, and his eventual path out of the Holdeman community. Wes begins by recounting his childhood in Barron, Wisconsin, a place where he spent the majority of his formative years. He reflects on the strong sense of community and belonging that characterized his early life, describing the close-knit nature of the Holdeman Mennonite congregation and the deep-rooted traditions that shaped his worldview. Despite the warmth and support of the community, Wes also touches on the restrictive aspects of growing up in a high-control environment, where conformity and adherence to church doctrines were paramount. As Wes delves deeper into his story, he shares poignant anecdotes about pivotal moments in his life. He speaks candidly about the internal struggles he faced as he began to question the teachings and practices of the church. These moments of doubt and introspection eventually led him to seek a life beyond the confines of the Holdeman community. One of the most compelling parts of Wes\u0027s narrative is his account of the personal and emotional challenges he encountered during his transition out of the church. He talks about the feelings of isolation and the loss of familial connections that often accompany such a significant life change. Despite these hardships, Wes\u0027s resilience and determination shine through as he describes how he rebuilt his life, forging new relationships and finding a sense of purpose outside the Holdeman Mennonite faith. Throughout the episode, Wes\u0027s storytelling is infused with a mix of humor, reflection, and raw honesty. He shares lighter moments that highlight the quirks and idiosyncrasies of life within the church, providing listeners with a nuanced perspective on the Holdeman experience. At the same time, his more serious reflections offer a profound insight into the personal cost of leaving a high-control religious group. Wes\u0027s story is not just one of leaving, but also of growth and self-discovery. He talks about the newfound freedoms and opportunities he has embraced since leaving the church, and how these have allowed him to explore his own identity and beliefs. His journey is a testament to the strength and courage it takes to break away from a life that no longer aligns with one\u0027s values and to seek out a path that is true to oneself. In this episode, listeners are invited to witness Wes\u0027s transformation from a young boy in Barron, Wisconsin, to a man who has navigated the complexities of faith, community, and personal identity. His story is a powerful reminder of the resilience of the human spirit and the enduring quest for authenticity and freedom.

      "description": "In this episode of Our People: Holdeman Mennonite Stories, we are joined by Stuart Litwiller, who shares his profound journey from being deeply involved in Church of God in Christ Mennonite to building a new life in Kenya. Stuart starts by recounting his early years in Carson City, Michigan, and his move to Murray, Kentucky, where he took on significant leadership roles within the church.\n\nStuart\u0027s story takes a pivotal turn as he describes his baptism at age 13, which left him feeling unchanged and disconnected from the spiritual transformation he had expected. By age 16, Stuart was ready to leave the church altogether, feeling a strong desire to break away from the faith that no longer resonated with him. He candidly shares the moment when a fellow youth member\u0027s genuine concern led him to reconsider his decision and ultimately resulted in his excommunication.\n\nStuart\u0027s path back to the church was fraught with uncertainty, yet he persisted in his search for spiritual fulfillment. His interactions with a man who would later become a minister, Tim Buck, were instrumental in his journey back to the church, where he was eventually reaccepted. Despite this, Stuart\u0027s spiritual journey continued to evolve, leading him to significant life changes.\n\nStuart recounts a cycle of excommunications and reacceptances, reflecting a continuous struggle with his faith. He shares how, at age 18, he enjoyed attending classes but found it difficult to return home, leading to another excommunication. This pattern repeated, with Stuart being reaccepted and then excommunicated again at age 22, shortly after his marriage.\n\nDespite managing to stay in the church until age 49, Stuart reveals that he never truly felt assured of his salvation or experienced the grace he sought. His final departure from the church was catalyzed by a disagreement with his wife over refinancing their debt, which escalated and involved church deacons. During a revival, Stuart was confronted by church leaders who suggested he was born again but never truly converted, leading to his excommunication.\n\nFeeling disillusioned, Stuart attempted to rejoin the church but ultimately decided to pursue a different path. He relocated to Katali, Kenya, seeking a fresh start. Stuart delves into the challenges and rewards of adapting to a new culture and building a new community. His resilience and determination shine through as he reflects on his journey from excommunication to establishing a fulfilling life in Kenya.\n\nListeners will be inspired by Stuart\u0027s story of leaving behind a restrictive religious environment, overcoming personal and spiritual struggles, and finding a new sense of purpose and community in Kenya. This episode offers a heartfelt exploration of faith, resilience, and the transformative power of new beginnings.\n\nJoin us for an insightful and moving conversation with Stuart Litwiller as he shares his remarkable journey of faith, loss, and renewal.\n\n\n\nFollow us on Facebook:\n\n\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060https://rb.gy/cj55td\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\n\nSubscribe on Spotify:\n\n\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060https://open.spotify.com/show/1KwYkbtbIswUN3z6JSrqz5?si=0913b1c334724490\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\n\nSubscribe on YouTube:\n\n\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060https://www.youtube.com/@OurPeoplePodcast\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\n\nSubscribe on Apple Podcasts:\n\n\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/our-people-holdeman-mennonite-stories/id1740613045\u2060",

      "description": "In this episode of Our People: Holdeman Mennonite Stories, we sit down with a young woman from the Abbotsford, British Columbia congregation of Church of God in Christ Mennonite, who we will call Charlotte for this interview. At 22, Charlotte shares her life story, starting with her unique family background. Her father is a generational Mennonite, deeply rooted in the traditions and values of the Holdeman Mennonite community. Her mother, however, was not born into the faith; a Mennonite family fostered her after her mother passed away and her father was unable to care for her. Charlotte\u0027s parents faced significant pressure from both their families and the Mennonite ministers to marry young after her mother became pregnant. This pressure led them to a hasty marriage, with their first child arriving six months later. Initially living in Manitoba, they had two sons before moving to British Columbia, where they had two more children, including Charlotte. Charlotte delves into the complexities of her family life, describing how her parents struggled to balance their responsibilities and the expectations of their faith community. The ministers in BC played a significant role in their lives, enforcing strict adherence to the church\u0027s rules. When Charlotte was around six months old, tensions within the community and within her family began to escalate. A particularly harrowing part of Charlotte\u0027s story involves the family separation enforced by the ministers. Her brothers were taken from the family by the ministers, a decision that deeply impacted Charlotte and her siblings. This separation was a profound and traumatic experience, adding to the emotional turmoil within the family. Her father remained a steadfast member of the Mennonite community, while her mother sought a different path, leading to further strain and eventual separation. Charlotte also reflects on her own journey of growth and self-discovery after leaving the Holdeman Mennonite faith. She speaks candidly about the challenges of forging a new identity outside the community and the support she found along the way. Her story is one of resilience, courage, and the enduring search for belonging. Join us to hear more about Charlotte\u0027s inspiring journey, her experiences with family separation, and the lessons she has learned about faith, family, and finding one\u0027s own path in life.

      "description": "In this episode of the Our People Podcast, titled \u0022Cam\u0027s Story of Building an Honest Life,\u0022 we delve into the life journey of Cam Isaac. Now residing in northern Alberta, Canada, Cam reflects on his life\u0027s narrative, emphasizing his evolution from adhering to external expectations to embracing a life grounded in honesty and self-acceptance. Raised in the deeply rooted Holdeman mennonite farming congregation in Crooked Creek, Alberta, Cam shares his upbringing in a congregation with a legacy spanning nearly a century. He discusses the complexities of growing up as the eldest child in a Holdeman community, where he adopted the \u0022good boy\u0022 persona to secure approval and avoid conflict. However, this facade led him to a cycle of dishonesty\u2014masking his true self to fit the mold expected by the church, his community. Cam\u2019s turning point came with his decision to leave the Holdeman faith, a move that reshaped his relationships and his sense of self. He openly discusses the challenges and liberation that came with breaking free from the religious and social expectations that had defined much of his life. This journey of self-discovery is punctuated by his diagnosis of cancer and a heart condition, which he sees not as a setback but as an opportunity for profound personal growth and reassessment of his life\u2019s priorities. Throughout the episode, Cam emphasizes the power of authenticity, the peace that comes with living true to one\u0027s self, and the importance of unconditional love, even when it means standing alone. His story is a testament to the strength found in vulnerability and the transformative power of living a life aligned with one\u0027s deepest truths.
