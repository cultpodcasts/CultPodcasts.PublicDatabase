      "description": "In this episode of the Our People Podcast, Dennis Goossen tells how his life\u0027s story entered and then exited the Holdeman church, Church of God in Christ Mennonite. He begins by describing his conversion experience and joining the church. Then he tells about a faith crisis and subsequent reconsecration in his late teens. From there, he married and started a family within the church. Finally, he describes his involvement in an effort to reform the more legalistic aspects of the church which resulted in a letter called \u0022A Plea For Revival\u0022. He was subsequently excommunicated, expelled, after church authorities demanded that he recant and retract the letter. Finally, he describes building a life after the Holdeman church and his latest project, forming a Christian school.

      "description": "In this episode of the Our People Podcast, titled \u0022Cam\u0027s Story of Building an Honest Life,\u0022 we delve into the life journey of Cam Isaac. Now residing in northern Alberta, Canada, Cam reflects on his life\u0027s narrative, emphasizing his evolution from adhering to external expectations to embracing a life grounded in honesty and self-acceptance. Raised in the deeply rooted Holdeman mennonite farming congregation in Crooked Creek, Alberta, Cam shares his upbringing in a congregation with a legacy spanning nearly a century. He discusses the complexities of growing up as the eldest child in a Holdeman community, where he adopted the \u0022good boy\u0022 persona to secure approval and avoid conflict. However, this facade led him to a cycle of dishonesty\u2014masking his true self to fit the mold expected by the church, his community. Cam\u2019s turning point came with his decision to leave the Holdeman faith, a move that reshaped his relationships and his sense of self. He openly discusses the challenges and liberation that came with breaking free from the religious and social expectations that had defined much of his life. This journey of self-discovery is punctuated by his diagnosis of cancer and a heart condition, which he sees not as a setback but as an opportunity for profound personal growth and reassessment of his life\u2019s priorities. Throughout the episode, Cam emphasizes the power of authenticity, the peace that comes with living true to one\u0027s self, and the importance of unconditional love, even when it means standing alone. His story is a testament to the strength found in vulnerability and the transformative power of living a life aligned with one\u0027s deepest truths.
