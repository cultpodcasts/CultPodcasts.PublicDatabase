Barb, a self-proclaimed wild child, shares how she always felt like a bit of a rebel in a community that prized conformity.\n\nBarb talks about her family\u0027s deep ties to the church, with both her parents raised within its strict confines. She recounts a touching story about her maternal grandfather, who, fearing for his soul, joined the church at the age of 90. This act underscores the intense pressure and indoctrination prevalent in their beliefs.\n\nThroughout the episode, Barb reflects on her spirited nature and the challenges it brought her in a high-control religious environment. She candidly discusses the moments that made her question her faith and ultimately led her to leave the church. A significant part of her story is discovering that being a wild child was not just okay but something to be celebrated.\n\nBarb shares how she saw herself in her daughter, who inherited her free spirit and zest for life. This realization helped Barb embrace her own nature, recognizing that her daughter\u0027s wonderful qualities were a reflection of her own.\n\nTune in to hear Barb Wedel\u0027s honest and heartfelt tale of growing up, rebelling, and finding freedom outside the Holdeman Mennonite Church.

      "description": "In this episode of Our People: Holdeman Mennonite Stories, we sit down with a young woman from the Abbotsford, British Columbia congregation of Church of God in Christ Mennonite, who we will call Charlotte for this interview. At 22, Charlotte shares her life story, starting with her unique family background. Her father is a generational Mennonite, deeply rooted in the traditions and values of the Holdeman Mennonite community. Her mother, however, was not born into the faith; a Mennonite family fostered her after her mother passed away and her father was unable to care for her. Charlotte\u0027s parents faced significant pressure from both their families and the Mennonite ministers to marry young after her mother became pregnant. This pressure led them to a hasty marriage, with their first child arriving six months later. Initially living in Manitoba, they had two sons before moving to British Columbia, where they had two more children, including Charlotte. Charlotte delves into the complexities of her family life, describing how her parents struggled to balance their responsibilities and the expectations of their faith community. The ministers in BC played a significant role in their lives, enforcing strict adherence to the church\u0027s rules. When Charlotte was around six months old, tensions within the community and within her family began to escalate. A particularly harrowing part of Charlotte\u0027s story involves the family separation enforced by the ministers. Her brothers were taken from the family by the ministers, a decision that deeply impacted Charlotte and her siblings. This separation was a profound and traumatic experience, adding to the emotional turmoil within the family. Her father remained a steadfast member of the Mennonite community, while her mother sought a different path, leading to further strain and eventual separation. Charlotte also reflects on her own journey of growth and self-discovery after leaving the Holdeman Mennonite faith. She speaks candidly about the challenges of forging a new identity outside the community and the support she found along the way. Her story is one of resilience, courage, and the enduring search for belonging. Join us to hear more about Charlotte\u0027s inspiring journey, her experiences with family separation, and the lessons she has learned about faith, family, and finding one\u0027s own path in life.

      "description": "In this episode of the Our People Podcast, titled \u0022Cam\u0027s Story of Building an Honest Life,\u0022 we delve into the life journey of Cam Isaac. Now residing in northern Alberta, Canada, Cam reflects on his life\u0027s narrative, emphasizing his evolution from adhering to external expectations to embracing a life grounded in honesty and self-acceptance. Raised in the deeply rooted Holdeman mennonite farming congregation in Crooked Creek, Alberta, Cam shares his upbringing in a congregation with a legacy spanning nearly a century. He discusses the complexities of growing up as the eldest child in a Holdeman community, where he adopted the \u0022good boy\u0022 persona to secure approval and avoid conflict. However, this facade led him to a cycle of dishonesty\u2014masking his true self to fit the mold expected by the church, his community. Cam\u2019s turning point came with his decision to leave the Holdeman faith, a move that reshaped his relationships and his sense of self. He openly discusses the challenges and liberation that came with breaking free from the religious and social expectations that had defined much of his life. This journey of self-discovery is punctuated by his diagnosis of cancer and a heart condition, which he sees not as a setback but as an opportunity for profound personal growth and reassessment of his life\u2019s priorities. Throughout the episode, Cam emphasizes the power of authenticity, the peace that comes with living true to one\u0027s self, and the importance of unconditional love, even when it means standing alone. His story is a testament to the strength found in vulnerability and the transformative power of living a life aligned with one\u0027s deepest truths.
