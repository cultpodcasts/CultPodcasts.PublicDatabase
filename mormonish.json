      "description": "On this episode of Mormonish Podcast, Rebecca and Landon are joined by special guest Wells Anderson as we delve into the world of swearing, Mormon swear words, and more.  Wells shares his recent experience of being denied medical care because he used the common expression \u0022Geez\u0022 in a text to his doctor. Taking offense at the use of that word, the doctor shared her religious point of view on \u0022swearing\u0022 and questioned whether Wells could be a patient. Social media has been discussing this situation with great interest and we are excited to have Wells tell us exactly what happened and join us for a larger discussion on the role of profanity in society and culture. ***How to DONATE to Mormonish Podcast:If you would like to financially support our podcast, you can DONATE to support Mormonish Podcast here:https://www.mormonishpodcast.org/supportAlso at:PayPal: https://paypal.me/BiblioTechMediaVenmo: @BiblioTechMediaWe appreciate our Mormonish viewers and listeners so much!Contact Mormonish Podcast: mormonishpodcast@gmail.com",

      "description": "On this episode of Mormonish Podcast, Rebecca and Landon delve into the current environment of confusion at the apparent mixed messages the LDS church is putting out regarding LGBT issues and the church\u0027s trajectory. We explore the broader picture of a church that appears to say one thing from the pulpit and then by their actions, indicate another point of view. This is causing a lot of confusion among more conservative and orthodox members of the church and the more progressive members. We agree that everyone is completely justified in their confusion. When you are operating in a theocracy that you look to for instructons on how to live your life and even what opinions and beliefs you should hold, confusing or mixed messages from the top is not acceptable. Join Mormonish as we dig deeper into this issue and itsw  ramifications for everyone no matter where you fall on the Mormon spectrum.Jacob Hanson Videohttps://youtu.be/DXVL5AYQ8dY?si=Fb0GIabAmhQSZIfz Greg Matsen Videohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26evOFf6mmoMormonish Podcast: Faith Matters Restorehttps://youtu.be/poBYvv9ClV4?si=Bk6pSkG2gvLjm4ZlHow to Donate to Mormonish Podcast:We appreciate our Mormonish viewers and listeners so much!

      "description": "In this episode of Mormonish Podcast, Rebecca and Landon sit down with Dr. John Lundwall to review and respond to criticisms from LDS apologists regarding our 5 part series on Book of Mormon authenticity. Our series with Dr. Lundwall showcases his ground breaking dissection and analysis of he Book of Mormon\u0027s authenticity from several different scholarly and scientific angles. Dr. Lundwall\u0027s episodes have the highest number of views on Mormonish Podcast because this information has not been explored to this level before. We appreciate Dr. Lundwall sharing his expertise with us in this important series and we felt it was valuable to have him address the apologists who have discussed his work on other channels. We would love to see any apologists come on an episode of Mormonish to talk with Dr. Lundwall directly. It\u0027s an open invitation!

This creates a big problem for the Pearl of Great Price and the LDS church itself.This is Part 1 of a two part series on The Book of\u00A0Abraham.\u00A0How to Donate to Mormonish Podcast:We appreciate our Mormonish viewers and listeners so much!
