      "description": "On this extremely informative episode of Mormonish Podcast, Rebecca and Landon sit down with our knowledgeable friend, Andrew Schnobrich, to do a deep, yet accessible dive into The Book of\u00A0Abraham.\u00A0Andrew has created a slide show and presentation that helps all of us more clearly understand the overwhelming problems with the BOA translation and Joseph Smith\u0027s claim to have translated it from Reformed Egyptian.Andrew\u0027s comprehensive slide presentation takes us through this translation process step by step, to help us understand the multiple problems and discrepencies that exist in what is supposed to be a prophetic\u00A0translation of a record written by Moses\u0027 own hand.Once you understand the real meaning of the characters and the drawings, it becomes obvious Joseph Smith did not translate this\u00A0papyri correctly by any stretch of the imagination. This creates a big problem for the Pearl of Great Price and the LDS church itself.This is Part 1 of a two part series on The Book of\u00A0Abraham.\u00A0How to Donate to Mormonish Podcast:We appreciate our Mormonish viewers and listeners so much!
