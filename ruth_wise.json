      "title": "Characteristics of Cults for Your Consideration",
      "description": "Dear viewers of this or any of my videos - Whether or not you are actually in a cult, sharing characteristics with cults should be concerning and should cause anyone to consider their ways. Very trained therapists I have had have said that minimally, I have been treated in cult-like ways over the years... and I know this to be true. I watched \u0022Scientology and Its Aftermath\u0022 with tears streaming down my face during some episodes, being able to identify with victims speaking out, or of whom others were speaking. As believers and as doers of God\u0027s Word, cult-like behaviors should not be characteristic of our practices.\n\nIn this video, I mainly read from a webpage of an international authority on cults, Janja Lalich (janjalalich.com/help/characteristics-associated-with-cults/).\n\nI also make a few feeble comments with a few examples of experiences, practices and observations that align to these characteristics, practiced in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022/\u0022The Local Churches\u0022. If I said more, and I have a lot more to say, the video would get too long.\n\nFor many, including myself for many years, it is hard to hear these words until/unless you reach a point in your life where destructive treatment directed at you or at someone you love is no longer bearable... then in order to heal, you begin to face the facts and to think soberly and, yes, critically, about your community, your choices (or lack thereof), the consequences of your choices, and how all of that compares to the characteristics of cults.",

      "description": "Dear fellow believers, if I and others are speaking the truth, because as lovers of God and of His church, we can no longer be silent , are we \u0022opposers\u0022? Believers doing all we can to fight for God\u0027s pure testimony are being smeared and silenced and stonewalled, accused of spreading unfounded rumors and false accusations. Maybe writers of this article are not considering me and other lovers of Jesus as such opposers - then wonderful! Please, let\u0027s meet and fellowship. I believe many like myself have been and are certainly \u0022misunderstood\u0022. The article I am addressing begins with the words, \u0022No one likes to be misunderstood...\u0022 referring to those \u0022in the Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022. To the writers of this article, I address this video. Have you sought to accurately understand ones you have labeled as opposers? If not, perhaps THEY are being misunderstood? Perhaps they  are 100% open to understanding if in any way they have misunderstood anything or anyone. We believers can expect misunderstanding, but we should do our best to be at peace with ALL men, and should not tolerate immorality and gross sins, covered up with dishonesty and hypocrisy, in the context what is being called \u0022the church.\u0022 We should judge the sin, confess and repent of it, and love one another warmly, allowing no division.",
