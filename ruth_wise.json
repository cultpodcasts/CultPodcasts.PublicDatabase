      "description": "If I could do so efficiently, I would read more sections from Brother Don Hardy\u0027s fellowship, reports of his decades serving in the local church with Witness Lee, and of his being mistreated and lied about after confronting gross sexual sins of both Timothy Lee  and Philip Lee. \n\nThe church in Rosemead suffered the loss of a real shepherd when, with no explanation, Don and his family were no longer welcome there, decided by a committee of five; the true explanation would have been helpful for all to know: Don had seen Philip Lee committing an adulterous act in the Living Stream Ministry office, so Philip determined, and had the clout, to get rid of him. Don and his family had to move from the house they were renting - an \u0022LSM\u0022-owned house. His family was extensively damaged. And his story is one of so many similar stories, of lies and abuse of power destroying precious marriages and families.\n\nThere is far too much financial corruption, \u0022spiritual\u0022 coercion, dishonesty, and sexual impropriety to fit into a Youtube video, and some I, like Don Hardy and all the others, have a hard time even mentioning, it is so defiling.\n\nOne verse Brother Don left with us in these 172 pages is: \nCorinthians 11:18\u201319: \u201CI hear that there are divisions among you. And I believe it in part, for there must be factions among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be recognized.\u201D\n\nWho is genuine? Who is truthful? Who is not hiding evil secrets that have countless victims?\n\nI am one with all believers in Christ, who are one with Christ. But we are never meant to be one with sin and lies and abuse. Don says: \u0022Brother, please know that I am NOT against any ministry which came out o f WL\u0027s mouth, from GOD. I receive it (...same as I would from the pope, if he too spoke God\u0027s Words, or truth); but I will NOT be a part of WL\u0027s and now PL\u0027s SINS! Even as they do, we all need to repent of many unconfessed things.\u0022  May we all be in the Light, enjoying the Life, in Love.... Correct me if I am wrong, but THIS is being in \u0022the Stream\u0022 - the one ministry - the ministry of the Spirit, and being one with THIS ministry, we keep the oneness... of the Spirit. It was never about any certain man, other than Jesus only. \n\nI refer to this precious document in this video: truestoryofdivisionmaking.com/uploads/3/4/7/1/34712424/rosemeadtrueaccount_1.pdf\n\n#livingstreamministry \n#localchurch \n#donhardy\n#witnesslee",

      "description": "Now I am sharing parts of 172 pages of emails from a dear, faithful servant of Christ who is now with his Master. This brother\u2019s writing is full of love, light, life, and factfulness. I knew many of the facts contained in his emails, but am am still shocked, sickened and heartbroken having read of so much evil covered up in what I believed to be a pure group of Christ followers. Believers deserve to know that corruption pervades the history and present leadership of \u201CThe Lord\u2019s Recovery.\u201D We know a tree by its fruit, and when I experienced fruits of the flesh from my own husband, then from his parents, and then from elders and coworkers, I arrived at the realization that I was being presented fleshly acts, from a  whole tree that is full of sexual immorality and impurity, uncleanness, lustful pleasures, lasciviousness, idolatry, hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions, envy, drunkenness, indulgence, and the like. Not reproving men - leaders in a Christian community no less - who practice and cover such things is sin. I cannot in good conscience call \u201CThe Lord\u2019s Recovery\u201D a group with a long history of covered up sins and lawlessness. We all make mistakes, but righteous people confess, repent, and repair relationships to restore peace with God and with fellow humans. Righteous people who may stray or fail admit the truth and turn from their wicked ways. But I am learning of so many decades of lies and corruption; I\u2019m discovering that the personal tragic undoing of my marriage and the torture I and my adult children still are trying to survive are just samplings of the evil fruit of \u201Cthis church\u2019s\u201D leadership, practices in direct opposition to God\u2019s Word.

He asked me what I would say to his daughter if she saw my videos, since he is hoping someday she will have a healthy church life. This is my short-version answer to her and to any young adult or teenager who might ask me about what I would recommend, related to the church.\n\nI would clarify or add to what I just recorded that under the point of genuineness - which should be the norm and which little children exemplify\u2026. A church should be a place where everyone can be genuine and is welcomed as they really are, not having to mask things or hide their wounds or their sicknesses. Young adults, teenagers, and anyone else should never have to pretend in order to be accepted in a church. We hear that the church is a hospital. It would not serve a patient well if they were expected to be fine, and had to act like everything is okay with them in a hospital.\n\nI welcome anyone else to share from their experiences, what you would say to a young adult seeking a healthy church life.",

      "description": "In this video I mainly read parts of the 1st section of this book, \u0022Celebrities for Jesus - How Personas, Platforms, \u0026 Profits Are Hurting the Church\u0022 by Katelyn Beaty (2022). The celebrity status of certain brothers/families has long troubled some close to me, and is, I believe, a main problem in the current (and historical) troubling situation in \u0022the church,\u0022 about which I have been speaking out. I mention in this video that Witness Lee and Philip Lee had such a dangerous and damaging celebrity status, but so do my father-in-law and my husband and many other highly regarded leading ones, in the same church community, to varying degrees, but to enough of a degree that what typical people would not get away with, they have, due to identification, \u0022love,\u0022 admiration, devotion... of many in public, while there is, behind closed doors, anger, abuse of power, cruel treatment of close family members, secrecy, giving in to temptation, and in some cases, addiction.\n\nI failed in this video to read aloud a paragraph (among many paragraphs) about Billy Graham, whom Beaty faithfully critiques regarding his celebrity status, but whose ministry was preserved due to a strict pact he made with his co-workers, the \u0022Modesto Manifesto,\u0022 to guard against common temptations. She writes (p. 38): \u0022Graham saw with prescient wisdom how intoxicating it would be for leaders to believe they are so important that they can evade accountability they need, even and perhaps especially when their work seems crucial for the kingdom. He saw that celebrity power\u0027s central lie is that an individual is important enough to be above the rules. He saw that celebrity so easily leads Christian leaders to use ministry to seek personal riches and thus defy the Bible\u0027s many warnings against greed and the love of money. He saw that celebrity causes many leaders to believe that they  can go it alone - that their individual ministries and platforms are more important and central than the  ordinary witness of local churches. And he saw that celebrity entices leaders to fudge the truth....\u0022\n\nSo applicable. Thank God for brothers who have cared, and who still care, for what went/goes on behind closed doors, even more than what is seen in public.",

Without these primary sources, trusting believers could be (and have been) more easily lied to and manipulated. We believers should not lie, nor protect lies, nor love lies  (Rev. 22:15). We love God, we love and obey His Word, we love our brothers without partiality, we abhor what is evil, and we rejoice in the truth.\n\nIn this video, I mainly read a letter written by brother Paul Kerr to K. Robichaux and R. Kangas in February 1990, just 2 months after the publication of the book \u0022A Response to Recent Accusations\u0022 - a defaming book aimed at belittling and tearing down a faithful, godly older brother\u0027s testimony to the flock under his care of why, after decades as a leading one, as a primary laborer with Witness Lee on the church hymnal and the Recovery Version of the New Testament, he needed to resign from the eldership in Anaheim. \n\nI am so thankful for all of those who spoke out and especially whose words are in print, who express the same desperate concerns I share, with a heart for the oneness of the unique Body of Christ, which \u0022Body\u0022 is NOT equivalent to those who identify as \u0022the Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022/\u0022the local churches\u0022, not restricted to adherents of Witness Lee - but comprised of all genuine believers in Christ.  \n\nThe open letter by Paul Kerr can be viewed at: www.johningalls.com/ARTRA/PaulKerrOnTheBody.pdf\n\n#johningalls\n#localchurch \n#lordsrecovery \n#thelordsrecovery \n#thelocalchurch",

I want oneness and peace, and I believe so do countless of my brothers and sisters who have reached out for fellowship about deeply offensive and wounding practices, behaviors and words too common among leaders in \u0022the Lord\u0027s Recovery.\u0022 Others desiring peace and oneness have been driven away by the cruel abuse experienced or witnessed in the church, and never spoke out publicly. I know many. And, yes, I put quotes around \u0022the Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022, because I don\u0027t believe my Lord would treat my brothers and sisters the way they have been and are being treated by many leaders in \u0022the\u0022 church, and anything abusive should never be called \u0022Recovery\u0022. So I ask you brothers, as you asked John Ingalls at the end of your book: \u0022We invite our brother[s] to treat this matter seriously and to take that proper biblical and human course of action that will produce genuine peace between [themselves] and the Body.\u0022 Many members of the Body have been and are extremely stumbled by the lack of accountability, the lack of righteousness, justice, and love toward ALL members - without partiality. Instead, there has been falsehood, gaslighting, mockery, sexual misconduct, financial corruption, defaming and despising of believers.... and I am asking that all of this get cleared up through repentance.",

I was an award -winning trainee (that\u2019s another topic\u2026). And I was the victim of multiple instances of abuse. \n\nI\u2019ve been accused of waiting until the other \u201Cparties\u201D died to speak out. I wasn\u2019t ready to speak out and lose (nearly) everything until, due to my marital crisis and the lack of effective help from responsible ones, I lost my church community and nearly everything else anyway. \n\nSome of my abusers are still alive. I wrote them emails, pleading for fellowship and reconciliation. I\u2019ve been lied about, lied to (and told when I point it out that I\u2019m on the \u201Cwrong tree\u201D), stonewalled, my personal female cycle discussed among elders and coworkers with my husband, falsely accused of various mental and emotional disorders\u2026 all because I tried to open up lines of communication, to get help, to fulfill my role as the counterpart of my husband in my home\u2026. \n\nI failed in restoring my marriage, but I was forced to look at the bigger picture, and have found that my marriage is in microcosm of a much bigger system of error.\n\nMy email is ruthewise@gmail.com. \n\nIf I spoke publicly about you in any of my videos, please know you are in good company if you are a sinner who repents. You can join all of us who can pray Psalm. 51 together and mean it.\n\nIf you are living and living lies, I hope you\u2019d be freed. \n\nIf you think that some are exempt from being accountable because of some position of authority, that\u2019s a big part of the problem. We are all accountable for our sins and for what we witness. \n\nSilence is complicity.\n\nLove rejoices with the truth.",

Churches in Taiwan and other countries in the Far East suffered similarly, and then the corruption continued in the United States. \n\nIt is a worthy endeavor to support Christian laborers, but there should be righteous handling of finances with transparency and accountability. Financial management and decisions should not be corrupt or illegal nor covered up by teachings related to covering brothers and submitting to deputy authority. \n\nSome in \u201Cthe Lord\u2019s Recovery\u201D are excessively wealthy, while others are in dire poverty. Leading brothers typically enjoy significant salaries and comfortable lifestyles, with protection from any accountability under the teaching of \u201CGod\u2019s government.\u201D Sadly, the most wealthy in the church seem also to enjoy special treatment, in my observation. And the needy ones, who still hand everything over to the God they live and serve, are blessed if tree from the love of money, but are too often abused while being expected to submit to \u201Cauthority.\u201D \n\nAnd if Christians speak out, related to matters that provoke their conscience, or if it gets too painful and unsustainable for victims of spiritual, marital, and/or financial abuse, believers in this group may appeal to the legal process, and be driven into deep debt or bankruptcy, seeking justice. \n\n#witnesslee #lordsrecovery #thelocalchurch #localchurch #livingstreamministry #thelordsrecovery #religiousabuse #cultrecovery #loveofmoney",

Their objective letter is corroborated by all the brothers labeled as \u201Crebellious\u201D in the book The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion. \n\nThat CRI article can be viewed at lcinfo.org/?page=writings/media/turmoil.\n\nYet in 1993 and again in 1996, elders in the church in Anaheim wrote letters of apology to Phillip Lee. These 9 brothers signed a letter stating that they \u201Cdo not believe that the public declaration of those three brothers concerning Philip Lee was justified or proper.\u201D\n\nI don\u2019t know of any apology or repentance from Philip. But elders asked him for forgiveness. Did the elders feel to protect sheep being molested by Philip Lee? No one reached out to me for 30 years, though my name was mentioned by a witness as a victim. What is not proper about publicly reproving an elder after receiving reports from multiple witnesses? (1 Tim. 5:20 says,  \u201C\uFFFCAs for those who persist in sin, rebuke them\uFFFC in the presence of all, so the rest may stand in fear.\u201D) How is rebuking a serial sexual predator in a church not justifiable or proper?

      "description": "I recently read on a forum that my videos kind of all say the same thing, or something like that. Forgive me for any wordiness or repetition. \n\nWhat am I hoping for in posting these videos\u2026 so feeble and too repetitive and unimpressively simple? \n\nWhat have dozens of sincere, devout believers hoped for, who have raised awareness - or tried to- of patterns of sinning in \u201CThe Lord\u2019s Recovery\u201D and of the covering up of those sins?\n\nI have heard a highly respected (that in itself being problematic...)\u0022senior co-worker\u0022 mocking an older brother who  confronted Brother Lee about some of the gross sins being covered up.  The \u0022senior coworker\u0022  mimicked how that elderly brother said he had to \u0022deeeaal with his conscience\u0022 (lowering his voice very deeply like that faithful brother\u0027s voice) - making a joke about such a phrase and scorning the brother. Dealing with our conscience is not something to mock. It is essential to keep the oneness and for us to properly love one another - the new commandment, by  which all men know that we are Jesus\u0027 disciples.\n\nI hope these videos and my blog (inconvenientruth.com) would join with the voices of many other dear and faithful believers who have not been able to remain silent about intolerable and unreal with sins. Many voices were silenced. Many who\u2019ve spoken out have been publicly shamed and lied about. Such ones face spiritual abuse. Many have lost precious friends and family members due to misrepresentation. \n\nBut silence is not an option once one\u2019s conscience is provoked, when the Lord in us is turning over tables in what should be house of prayer, but has become a den of thieves (Matt. 21:13; Mark 11:17; Luke 19:46). \n\nThe goal of every single video and every single blog I post is \u201Clove, which comes from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith\u201D (1 Tim. 1:5). \n\nTo have healthy love for one another, we need a pure heart and a good conscience and sincere faith. I learned as a little child how to take care of my conscience and it\u2019s something that no believer should ever graduate from. \n\nI pray that any involved would humble ourselves and pray and seek God\u2019s face and turn from our wicked ways, that God would hear and forgive and heal our land (2 Chron. 7:14).\n\n#localchurch \n#witnesslee \n#lordsrecovery \n#spiritualabuse\n#denofrobbers",

      "description": "This is another painful and heavy video to record and post, but unless we deal with the pattern of sinning and covering up sins in \u201CThe Lord\u2019s Recovery,\u201D we are not honoring God\u2019s Word. \n\nGod is not a respecter of persons, nor should we be.\n\nIn this video I review a book in a very brief way. The book is My Unforgettable Memories- Watchman Nee\u0026 Shanghai Local Church. The author was a young sister in the church with Watchman Nee. She did extensive research to verify her accounts, which include many eyewitness accounts and letters. There are many witnesses of gross sins committed by Watchman Nee throughout decades in China. The only reason anyone would refuse to believe this to be at least possible, refuse to hear multiple witnesses and refuse to address a long history of damaging practices, including a person being called a \u201Ddelegate [or deputy] authority\u201D being unquestionable and unaccountable, is that we have made some leaders idols - not humans like the rest of us including King David who are not above sinning - and not above being rebuked and openly repenting. \n\nDon\u2019t excommunicate me for speaking my concerns. I am deeply concerned partly because I am a direct victim of sexual immorality practiced and covered up in the Lords recovery, that has yet to be addressed by anyone in leadership, although several knew about it over 35 years ago. And I am aware of many more cases. And we should repent for idolizing anyone\u2026 even a \u201CMinister of the Age.\u201D",

In my youth this didn\u2019t sound right. It sounded controlling, diminishing and limiting of all the members of the church, each with their precious portions and experiences and light from God\u2019s Word. \n\nOne may reason such things away, justifying them by various verses like Paul saying to the Philippians that we should all speak the same thing. But he didn\u2019t charge them to say only what he said. I\u2019ve heard the exposition that Paul means we should all speak Christ - the multifaceted, unsearchable, measureless riches of Christ and goodness of God\u2026 and we need eternity for that. NOT as tape recorders but as those with a personal knowing and seeing of Christ and all the riches in God\u2019s Word.\n\nTo have an attitude that we can only speak with another person, a leader, has spoken can very easily become culty - controlling, and totalitarian, etc.\n\nI am off to meet with believers, but thought I would post this for fellowship among anyone who wants to participate.

      "description": "Without partiality and favoritism I feel to keep speaking out about multiple cases in which responsible ones in the Local Church and in \u201CThe Lord\u2019s Recovery\u201D did not deal properly with sins. These are not victimless sins. They damage the hearts and families of targets and victims. The damage can extend even for generations. The damage doesn\u2019t disappear or heal with silence, but through applying God\u2019s Word faithfully, which involves rebuking and reproving, in the case of leading ones, publicly, and they\u2019re being repentance and forgiveness.\n\nThe practice in the Lords recovery has been to publicly rebuke people who speak out, and to quarantine them and label them as poisonous and negative. I am not poisonous or negative. I can\u2019t tolerate these patterns in what is being called \u201CThe Lord\u2019s Recovery.\u201D Lives are being destroyed. \n\nBrothers, what is the motive of stank silent about these improprieties and sins? Is it because of partiality towards certain families? Is it because of financial gain that may be affected if people hold you accountable? \n\nWe live before the Lord. It is better to deal with offenses and sins in this age, while we are still on our way home to meet the Lord.\n\nI\u2019d like to add, related the sexual abuse my daughter experienced from a son of Ben Phillips, Jr.:\n\n1) Brother Ben, when you made that appeal at your dad\u2019s memorial for those who have \u201Cleft\u201D to \u201Ccome back\u201D - brother, if we left a particular gathering of believers because we weren\u2019t safe, we weren\u2019t protected by leaders, and we were ignored and/or shamed if we spoke out, how/why would we return to that environment? And I refuse to call such an environment \u201Cthe\u201D church\u2026. Yes, the church in Corinth had problems, but hopefully they were dealt with properly and thoroughly by leaders. Eventually their testimony faded. Eventually the lampstand was removed from the church in Ephesus. You can have the right name but not be the reality of a church as a lampstand. \n\n2) I am not speaking about this matter to shame any minors in the church. They need care and shepherding and protection and guidance from the older ones. Both my daughter and this other young person, were suffering, deep depression and family-related pain. They found a lot of solace in being together and talking honestly together. But personal boundaries should always be honored. When my daughter asked for help, help could\u2019ve been given, but her appeals were ignored.\n\n3) To Christy\u2019s grandparents, Willie and Rosalind Wise, she opened to you about her being molested. You told her to not say anything about it, but to cover the family. You should have protected your granddaughter (or any other victim opening to you) - not the image of a high profile family. We should protect every victim of sexual violence, assault, and harassment, without partiality or favoritism.\n\nTo all, this is a PATTERN in \u201CThe Lord\u2019s Recovery\u201D and it is not sustainable. There needs to be proper rebuking and repenting and forgiveness and restoration in cases such as those I mention in this video. \n\n#thelocalchurch \n#lordsrecovery",

      "description": "In this video, I speak out about a member of my spiritual family, who has not been shepherded properly to repent and to be restored to the fellowship, but rather his sins that have stumbled many, and his disappearance that grieves even more of us, are all covered up and \u0022not spoken about\u0022 (except in small circles). This is contrary to GOD\u0027S Word, which says, \u0022Do not entertain an accusation against an elder unless it is brought by two or three witnesses. But those elders who are sinning you are to reprove before everyone, so that the others may take warning.  I charge you, in the sight of God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels, to keep these instructions without partiality, and to do nothing out of favoritism\u0022 (I Tim. 5:19-21).\n\nI am just a \u0022little\u0022 (53-year-old) sister but I can\u0027t bear the lack of practicing what is in God\u0027s Word, in the name of \u0022covering brothers,\u0022 in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery.\u0022 What about protecting endangered wives? What about comforting heart-broken children and grandchildren? What about loving one another enough to reprove publicly, for there to be public warning and public repentance and full forgiveness and restoration?\n\nThere should be no favoritism, no partiality. If you rebuke brothers publicly who are maintaining a clean conscience, speaking truthfully, but whose speaking may tarnish the reputation of an individual or an organization, but you are covering up gross sins of leading brothers, trying to hide the truth, that is partiality.\n\nAs long as I am alive, I won\u0027t stand by, but I will speak up and speak out the truth... the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God. We are ALL affected by lies in our communities and especially in the church (composed of ALL believers), including lies of ommission, and by the loss of the function of fellow members who fall into sin or are excommunicated for speaking up about sins that need to be dealt with scripturally.\n\nTo the brother I address, and to his family, I hope you receive my words in this public way only from my heart of love and my deep desire for restoration and for preservation of the Lord\u0027s testimony and genuine oneness, apart from sin, among ALL His believers, wherever and with whomever we may be practically meeting.\n\nLove finds no joy in unrighteousness but rejoices in the truth (1 Cor. 13:6).\n\n#lordsrecovery \n#thelocalchurch \n#witnesslee \n#cultrecovery",

Our oneness should not depend on any special affiliation to one particular ministry and the exclusion of others\u0027 ministries.\n\nAnd we should not use godliness as a means for financial gain (1 Tim. 6:5).\n\nIf a church (\u0022THE church\u0022) is required to have/speak/read only \u0022one ministry,\u0022 based on one or two brothers\u0027 speaking, and a non-profit publishing company is very enmeshed with THE church, financially and practically, and that publishing company sells only those two brothers\u0027 writings, there is a huge incentive to silence anything that would cause serious, legitimate and scriptural concerns among followers regarding the publishing company, the churches, and especially leading ones including the \u0022commander\u0022 (Elders Training Book 7, 1986, bibleread.online/all-books-by-Watchman-Nee-and-Witness-Lee/book-elders-training-book-07-one-accord-for-the-lords-move-Witness-Lee-read-online/6/).\n\n[From that same Elders Training book just cited, here are 2 pertinent paragraphs I didn\u0027t read in the  video:\n\n\u0022Some saints came to me a number of times with reports concerning serious and even negative situations. They may have misunderstood my not responding to them with any kind of seriousness. I believe I did not respond in this way not only out of my patience and toleration but also because of the Lord\u2019s wisdom. I feel that it is altogether wise to be patient. When the fruit of a particular tree is growing, the fruit itself will show what it is. When the fruit becomes ripe, it will fall from the tree. At this point, however, I do not feel that I should tolerate certain situations any longer, because enough damage has been done already. I do not like to see more damage done to the Lord\u2019s recovery. I have no time, dear saints, to fool around with people any longer. Let us go to fight the battle. Who are the \u201Cus\u201D? They are the ones who are desperate with no opinion.\n\nand...\n\u0022It is altogether not wise for you to remain in the recovery taking this ministry on the one hand and yet on the other hand to say something else. This is not wise. It is not profitable to yourself or to your future. You may say that you have a ministry, but this is not profitable to your ministry if you have one. You can never profit your ministry in the future in this way. Rather, you have dispensed your future in a cheap way. The wise way is to stay, without any opinion, with the recovery, which is unique.\u0022]\n\nIf there is abuse in THE church and/or in the Ministry office of the publication company, to remain \u0022faithful\u0022 in the church and \u0022faithful to the ministry\u0022  - or \u0022one with the ministry\u0022  - seems to require that you look the other way rather than confront and deal with stumbling sin. Such \u0022oneness\u0022 of \u0022the Body\u0022 is actually a loyalism to a corrupt system/organization with a financial conflict of interest. \n\nI don\u0027t do justice in this video (nor in any video)... but hopefully this is a start.\n\nAdd to this the fact that much money is brought in by the activities of the Living Stream Ministry that supports many \u0022faithful to the ministry.\u0022 What if such ones were to say, \u0022Sin is not acceptable. Sexual harrassment is illegal and should be dealt with seriously.\u0022 Would they lose their financial support? Would they be shunned?\n\nOh, wait, this happened. And such ones were labeled \u0022rebellious\u0022 and \u0022poisonous\u0022 and lied about and excommunicated (\u0022quarantined\u0022).\n\nWe were cheated from their ministry - which I believe each and every member of Christ\u0027s body has.\n\nOur oneness must not depend on oneness with anyone other than the Triune God. If it is, we are very likely in a cult.\n\n#witnesslee \n#lordsrecovery \n#thelocalchurch \n#cultrecovery",

I believe all who have spoken out and those still speaking out have risked very much because to not do so is complicity with such sins, and stumbling of others will continue until there is righteousness at the leadership level in any church community.",

      "description": "Dear viewers of this or any of my videos - Whether or not you are actually in a cult, sharing characteristics with cults should be concerning and should cause anyone to consider their ways. Very trained therapists I have had have said that minimally, I have been treated in cult-like ways over the years... and I know this to be true. I watched \u0022Scientology and Its Aftermath\u0022 with tears streaming down my face during some episodes, being able to identify with victims speaking out, or of whom others were speaking. As believers and as doers of God\u0027s Word, cult-like behaviors should not be characteristic of our practices.\n\nIn this video, I mainly read from a webpage of an international authority on cults, Janja Lalich (janjalalich.com/help/characteristics-associated-with-cults/).\n\nI also make a few feeble comments with a few examples of experiences, practices and observations that align to these characteristics, practiced in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022/\u0022The Local Churches\u0022. If I said more, and I have a lot more to say, the video would get too long.\n\nFor many, including myself for many years, it is hard to hear these words until/unless you reach a point in your life where destructive treatment directed at you or at someone you love is no longer bearable... then in order to heal, you begin to face the facts and to think soberly and, yes, critically, about your community, your choices (or lack thereof), the consequences of your choices, and how all of that compares to the characteristics of cults.",

Perhaps they  are 100% open to understanding if in any way they have misunderstood anything or anyone.

      "description": "This is a simple introduction to what I intend to be an ongoing series about my experiences of abuse and abusive patterns in my marriage, family, and Christian community, but also words and experiences of healing and of thriving - not only in spite of the past trauma, but even BECAUSE of it. \n\nIf you can relate this podcast, I want you to know you are not alone, and that God is near to the brokenhearted (Ps. 34:18). And with God near - more near than anything else, everything will be more than okay.",
