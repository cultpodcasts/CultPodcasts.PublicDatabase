      "description": "Since the 1930s, sexual immorality has been committed and tolerated, the covering up of which has caused huge damage to the church. \n\nHow has this happened? There has been a teaching that there are some members above other members, and one cannot \u0022criticize\u0022 but rather must \u0022cover\u0022 those \u0022above\u0022 him/her... so leaders can do, and have done and continue to do, evil and immoral things with no accountability. \n\nBut how can we fall into such a trap? The teaching that we must not use our minds disables our God-given faculties from working to preserve us. We must love God with all our.... minds. The mature have their faculties exercised to discern. \n\nChristians should not be members of a heirarchy, but of a Body, where germs and disease, no matter where they may be in the body, are taken as serious and properly treated - not covered up out of respect for an individual member or group. \n\nTolerating and covering up gross sins is not recovery. Christ\u0027s Bride is clothed with fine linen - the righteousnesses of the saints. \n\nThis video focuses on the 1930s-50s in China, related to a truly worshipped leader of \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 - Watchman Nee.\n\n#watchmannee #thelocalchurch #localchurch #livingstreamministry #lordsrecovery #thelordsrecovery",

You have been fighting for believers to know the truth about matters that continue to stumble many... I was one of those stumbled, as were my children.\n\nWhen I first began experiencing this now years-long crisis of cognitive dissonance and practical disorientation, when so much of what I had learned from God\u0027s Word throughout my life seemed to be contradicted by my church environment and in my marriage, when leaders seemed helpless in helping me and my now-adult children who have been literally desperate for help... God provided much-needed help in precious resources from some of you. \n\nYour sharing from your hearts and from the Word helped to make sense of the otherwise nonsense.\n\nYour testimonies and faithful speaking from your conscience about stumbling matters resonated with my experiences. \n\nWhen I began reaching out to some of you personally about my pain and confusion and challenges, some of you answered me with words of love and kindness and grace. \n\nWhen I began posting blogs and videos and updates on the internet, some of you reached out. \n\nSome of the most precious connections (in some cases, re-connections) in my life have been made in these past months, while we who have been wounded support our fellow wounded sheep on various platforms and forums.\n\nYou who care, who love in truth and who love the truth, are gamechangers.\n\nThank you.",

      "description": "Published words (by Living Stream Ministry), along with despising attitudes and multiple reports of sexual impropriety, in addition to my own personal experiences, are disgraceful related to the treatment of women (sisters) in \u0022the local churches\u0022; the sum of so many cruel words and accounts all really bothered me deeply today, and I believe all contribute toward the abuse of women (\u0022sisters\u0022) in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery.\u0022 \n\nI don\u0027t expound too much in this video - I mainly read some excerpts from \u0022the Ministry\u0022 that I find very cruel and oppressive regarding sisters, and an eyewitness account of sexual immorality in the Living Stream office in the \u002770s that was never dealt with, and which continued to victimize sisters into the late 80s, if not longer. Such treatment is clearly a pattern in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery.\u0022 Diminishing attitudes, words and treatment are pervasive in this group, and I could only confront it head-on when I was the target in my own marriage and couldn\u0027t protect my children from much impact of the abuse, with no (or with minimal, grossly inadequate) support from \u0022the local church\u0022 leaders.\n\nI understand - many sisters (I was one of them) feel honored to be sisters, to simply serve and submit. But if there is too much abuse, one begins to seek help, and when there is no help, one has to confront the issues, and when I did that, I found, and I\u0027m sure I will continue to find, reasons I have been treated so cruelly, found in the teachings and practices of those who consider themselves \u0022responsible ones\u0022 in what they teach and believe are the ONLY legitimate churches on the earth.\n\nI could say SO much more... but am trying to keep these videos brief. Thanks for caring and feel free to comment. I really appreciate the fellowship and constructive engagement on this platform.\n\n#thelocalchurch #lordsrecovery #localchurches #thelordsrecovery #livingstreamministry",

      "title": "Addressing Leaders in the Lord\u0026#39;s Recovery, Specifically at the 2024 Thanksgiving Conference",
      "description": "This video may or may not be worth your time. I am mainly holding accountable past recipients of emails I sent - almost 4 years ago - seeking help, and those recipients\u0027 fellow \u0022co-workers\u0022 in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022. The abuse I wrote about continues to this day.\n\nIn this video message, I address the responsible leaders in the Lord\u0027s Recovery ministry, emphasizing the importance of confession and recompense based on Watchman Nee\u0027s teachings, since you claim to follow HIM. \n\nI speak on behalf of many who have suffered the negligence and abuse of leaders in this group, in spite of countless pleas for help, for intervention, for change, for justice, for righteousness, for reconciliation, for oneness.... We offer proof for what you call \u0022baseless accusations,\u0022 while you blame us for lying, being people of death, being evil, though you specify no scriptural offense for which any of us can repent....\n\nI share some of my personal experiences and challenges faced over the past  recent years, mainly through reading a couple emails and texts previously sent to several of you (who are likely gathered at the Thanksgiving Conference in Atlanta this weekend). To these desperate emails I received minimal to no response from \u0022responsible ones.\u0022 Most responses from \u0022responsible ones\u0022 which I have received to these and other pleas, in my perspective, constitute further abuse. \n\nWatchman Nee writes in Messages for Building Up New Believers, published by the Living Stream Ministry (bibleread.online/all-books-by-Watchman-Nee-and-Witness-Lee/book-messages-for-building-up-new-believers-vol-2-Watchman-Nee-read-online/22/): \n\n\u0022In order to live under God\u2019s light, we need a sensitive conscience, and in order for our conscience to remain sensitive, we need to continually condemn sin as sin. We need to confess to God, and we also need to make confessions and recompenses to man....\n\n\u0022If you remember that your brother has something against you, this means you have transgressed against him. Your transgression may or may not be in material things. Perhaps you have offended him by acting unrighteously towards him. The emphasis is not on material things but on that which sets others against you. \n\n\u0022A new believer should realize that if he offends a person and does not apologize and ask for forgiveness, he is finished as soon as the offended party mentions his name and sighs before God. Whatever he offers to God will not be accepted. Whatever he prays will be turned down. We should not allow any brother or sister to sigh before God because of us. Once he or she sighs, we are finished before God. If we have done something wrong or if we have offended or hurt someone, the offended party need not accuse us before God. All he has to say before God is, \u201COh! So-and-so...\u201D or, for that matter, he just needs to utter an \u201COh\u201D and whatever we offer to God will be rejected. All he has to do is sigh a little because of us before God. We must not give any brother or sister the reason or the ground to sigh before God because of us. If we give him or her a reason to sigh, we will lose all our spiritual prospects and all our gifts to God will be annulled....\n\n \u0022If you are offering a gift at the altar and remember that your brother has anything against you or has any reason to sigh because of you, do not offer up your gift. If you want to offer to God, \u201CFirst go and be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.\u201D God wants the gift, but you must first be reconciled to others. Those who are not reconciled to men will not be able to offer a gift to God.\n\n\u0022Hopefully, the brothers and sisters will be thorough in the matter of confession and recompense. This is the way to maintain their purity. If anyone has transgressed against man, he should confess his sins to God on the one hand, and he must deal with the matter seriously with man on the other hand.\u0022\n\nViewers, especially \u0022responsible ones\u0022 in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 are encouraged to reflect on the significance of taking responsibility for your part in the damage of my marriage and family, to consider your part in the all-too-common mistreatment of others (sisters and brothers in Christ, precious enough to be redeemed by His own blood), to confess, and to offer recompense for your wrongdoings, if the Lord shines on you that you had any part in abuse and/or sins that have hurt and/or are still hurting anyone. Many of us are sighing to God about you.\n\n#lordsrecovery #localchurch #localchurches #livingstreamministry",

      "description": "To all believers in Christ who care, who want and seek the oneness of Christ\u0027s Body, and who hate abuse... specifically to my dear friends, brothers and sisters in Christ attending this week\u0027s Living Stream Ministry Thanksgiving Conference:\n\nI understand. I was just like you. I felt excited, special, blessed... any time I could participate in one of the \u0022Seven Feasts\u0022 in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 (TLR).\n\nAfter all, we had been \u0022delivered\u0022 from \u0022degraded Christianity.\u0022 We were chosen, called, and faithful. We were, without usually admitting it, an elite group, superior to other Christians. Others were so worldly. We were consecrated and most like the early churches. We were most likely to be overcomers. We were Philadelphia... I believed...\n\n...Until I realized that there wasn\u0027t actually, practically the necessary brotherly love in my desperate situation, but rather extreme partiality and heirarchy and rampant abuse and teachings that twisted the Bible to cover sin and abusers \n\n...Until I couldn\u0027t attend gatherings anymore, due to abuse that I couldn\u0027t hide and about which I was warned not to speak, but which is hurting and stumbling me and my adult children to this day... \n\n...Until I realized SO MUCH financial corruption and other sins are being covered up, and lies are being told, and my brothers and sisters are being slandered and banned from such conferences and any other \u0022church\u0022 meetings - due to their faithfully judging sins and seeking to clear up ongoing stumbling actions and inaction in TLR. \n\n...Until I couldn\u0027t subscribe to a leadership and publishing company that profits to the extent of making the \u0022minister of the age\u0022 a multimillionaire, publishing books of ministers who say they stand on the shoulders of so many believers while belittling and shaming those believers and not giving credit for, nor remaining open to, the light and life and ministry of every member of Christ\u0027s Body - even going as far as to call other ministers rebellious for not submitting to the singular Minister of the Age, the Oracle of God, the Wise Master Builder, God\u0027s Deputy Authority on the earth.....\n\n...Until I couldn\u0027t bear the use of money to abuse me, and finding a systemic disparity of wealth between the powerful leaders and other privileged and highly regarded members - while the abused whistleblowers like me are marginalized and even desperate needs are completely overlooked.\n\n...Until I realized that the haughty attitude that pervades \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery,\u0022 of somehow being better than other believers or other gatherings of believers IS sin and IS divisive.\n\nSo to all my dear friends who are attending the \u0022Thanksgiving Conference\u0022 online or in-person in Atlanta, perhaps you consider yourselves special. Maybe you consider yourselves objects of God\u0027s mercy since you consider yourselves still \u0022in the Lord\u0027s Recovery,\u0022 that you haven\u0027t \u0022left\u0022 in a \u0022rebellion.\u0022 I thought that too, for decades. Now I know what I was told were rebellions were actually events when believers\u0027 consciences forced them to confront leaders regarding untenable hypocrisy, rampant sexual misconduct, retaliatory false accusations of saints, and unbearable abuse; and that for confronting leadership regarding these sins, these faithful saints, some direct victims of crimes committed by leaders in TLR, were labeled as poisonous and rebellious, and they were quarantined - banned from any further fellowship with members in \u0022the\u0022 (\u0027genuine\u0022, \u0022on the ground of oneness\u0022) churches.\n\n#localchurch #livingstreamministry #lordsrecovery #thelocalchurch",

This is a far-from-perfect take, but my fingers are not as calloused as they used to be, and I already recorded several takes.\n\nThis song is truly for ALL who have been hurt, it is to the shepherds of God\u0027s sheep, and most of all, this song is to the Lord, our Good, Faithful, Great Shepherd Who WILL heal us, bring each of His lambs back, and carry us all through these trials, all the way to glory.\n\nThe original tune came to me in the Fall of 1992, while I was staying with a family whose father/husband went to be with the Lord during that time. The tune never left my heart since then. The words came to me, hours after my husband drove away from the office where I was working, a few weeks ago, after I shook (physically) for those hours and tried to record a video of me speaking, trying to explain to viewers the effects of abuse I and others have experienced at the hand of \u0022shepherds\u0022 in my former church community. Unable to speak, I found my outlet through this song. The words are largely from Ezekiiel 34.",

      "description": "A common thread in the treatment of (former) members of \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022 (TLR) is a pattern of many vague accusations, without actually rebuking these believers for actual, specific sins. Those who are being accused have definite sins that are being covered up - a practice that is contrary to keeping the oneness. Sins must be judged for the sake of the keeping of the oneness. I share 4 examples, as well as excerpts from Watchman Nee that expound on versus in 1 John, that judging sins is the basis for oneness - since our fellowship is in the light, where sin is properly dealt with. The second excerpt is from \u0022Resist the Devil\u0022 in which Watchman Nee states that Satan\u0027s accusations are not clear, and they make us feel worthless. Believers who rebuke a sinning saint do so because that saint is precious, valued, worth rebuking because we don\u0027t want to lose one another, nor to lose the fellowship, the oneness. Treating others with the silent treatment and with vague accusations does not show a valuing of fellow believers - the desire to restore, recover, and reconcile.\n\n#localchurch \n#lordsrecovery \n#thelocalchurch \n#thelordsrecovery \n#livingstreamministry \n#spiritualabuse",

      "description": "In what its members call the \u201CLord\u2019s recovery\u201D, I experienced and continue to experience the complete opposite of generational blessing and generational passing on of what is righteous from my husband\u2019s family, many of whom are very active and in leadership roles in this Christian group. They also have not practiced keeping God\u2018s basic laws and refuse to communicate with me to remedy this matter and to restore fellowship and harmony, which is especially critical for the younger ones who are affected by the breach of fellowship the most, perhaps. As I sought for scriptural reconciliation with family members, extending my pleas for help to leading ones in the church, I began to realize that the entire group is based on a leadership that behaves much like my in-laws. There\u2019s a rejection of what is in God\u2019s word and shaming of people who bring up offenses, violations to God\u2018s word, and seek to deal with those offenses in the scriptural way, particularly if it contradicts what the group refers to as the ministry of the age, if it pertains to righteousness, and if it makes anyone in leadership \u201Clook bad\u201C. \n\nThis was highlighted to me yesterday by a contrast, at a bar mitzvah, in which a Jewish community exhibited an intergenerational blessing of one another and passing down of the law of God, teaching the young ones to do what is right and just and good, something our God would never abolish, something that our Lord Jesus came to fulfill, a righteous living that surpasses the scribes and Pharisees\u2019 living, which believers in Christ should be still expressing today.",

      "description": "Reading the correspondence between a brother in South Africa, who had been in Europe in the late 80\u2019s, and Bob Danker is so provoking to my spirit. I wanted to record this video sooner but have been sick. This needs to heard and known, because THIS affects the whole Body of Christ. Bob\u2019s words and attitude represent the whole leadership of \u201CThe Lord\u2019s Recovery.\u201D It is an attitude of defending and uplifting Witness Lee amidst unconscionable treatment of other equally precious members.\n\nRon and Kerry, you wrote that John Ingalls\u2019 very proper and scriptural sharing with the church in Anaheim affected (potentially damaged) the whole Body? It did affect us, and I am forever grateful for his constitution, ministry and living; John Ingalls shared the truth, in love. He provided us as much of the truth as God led him to share at the time.  Did Philip Lee\u2019s assaults on sisters affect the whole Body? YES.\n\nAnd as Dr. Lily Hsu writes in her book, My Unforgettable Memories, the covered up sins are one thing, and are very serious, but the continuing idolatrous worship of Nee and Lee are still a major stumbling and factor of division for many believers.\n\nEli\u2019s not dealing with his son\u2019s warranted record in the Word of God. We must learn from and rightly apply God\u2019s Word.",

Don and his family had to move from the house they were renting - an \u0022LSM\u0022-owned house. His family was extensively damaged. And his story is one of so many similar stories, of lies and abuse of power destroying precious marriages and families.\n\nThere is far too much financial corruption, \u0022spiritual\u0022 coercion, dishonesty, and sexual impropriety to fit into a Youtube video, and some I, like Don Hardy and all the others, have a hard time even mentioning, it is so defiling.\n\nOne verse Brother Don left with us in these 172 pages is: \nCorinthians 11:18\u201319: \u201CI hear that there are divisions among you. And I believe it in part, for there must be factions among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be recognized.\u201D\n\nWho is genuine? Who is truthful? Who is not hiding evil secrets that have countless victims?\n\nI am one with all believers in Christ, who are one with Christ. But we are never meant to be one with sin and lies and abuse. Don says: \u0022Brother, please know that I am NOT against any ministry which came out o f WL\u0027s mouth, from GOD. I receive it (...same as I would from the pope, if he too spoke God\u0027s Words, or truth); but I will NOT be a part of WL\u0027s and now PL\u0027s SINS! Even as they do, we all need to repent of many unconfessed things.\u0022  May we all be in the Light, enjoying the Life, in Love.... Correct me if I am wrong, but THIS is being in \u0022the Stream\u0022 - the one ministry - the ministry of the Spirit, and being one with THIS ministry, we keep the oneness... of the Spirit. It was never about any certain man, other than Jesus only. \n\nI refer to this precious document in this video: truestoryofdivisionmaking.com/uploads/3/4/7/1/34712424/rosemeadtrueaccount_1.pdf\n\n#livingstreamministry \n#localchurch \n#donhardy\n#witnesslee",

      "description": "Now I am sharing parts of 172 pages of emails from a dear, faithful servant of Christ who is now with his Master. This brother\u2019s writing is full of love, light, life, and factfulness. I knew many of the facts contained in his emails, but am am still shocked, sickened and heartbroken having read of so much evil covered up in what I believed to be a pure group of Christ followers. Believers deserve to know that corruption pervades the history and present leadership of \u201CThe Lord\u2019s Recovery.\u201D We know a tree by its fruit, and when I experienced fruits of the flesh from my own husband, then from his parents, and then from elders and coworkers, I arrived at the realization that I was being presented fleshly acts, from a  whole tree that is full of sexual immorality and impurity, uncleanness, lustful pleasures, lasciviousness, idolatry, hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions, envy, drunkenness, indulgence, and the like. Not reproving men - leaders in a Christian community no less - who practice and cover such things is sin. I cannot in good conscience call \u201CThe Lord\u2019s Recovery\u201D a group with a long history of covered up sins and lawlessness. We all make mistakes, but righteous people confess, repent, and repair relationships to restore peace with God and with fellow humans.

He asked me what I would say to his daughter if she saw my videos, since he is hoping someday she will have a healthy church life. This is my short-version answer to her and to any young adult or teenager who might ask me about what I would recommend, related to the church.\n\nI would clarify or add to what I just recorded that under the point of genuineness - which should be the norm and which little children exemplify\u2026. A church should be a place where everyone can be genuine and is welcomed as they really are, not having to mask things or hide their wounds or their sicknesses. Young adults, teenagers, and anyone else should never have to pretend in order to be accepted in a church. We hear that the church is a hospital. It would not serve a patient well if they were expected to be fine, and had to act like everything is okay with them in a hospital.\n\nI welcome anyone else to share from their experiences, what you would say to a young adult seeking a healthy church life.",

      "description": "In this video I mainly read parts of the 1st section of this book, \u0022Celebrities for Jesus - How Personas, Platforms, \u0026 Profits Are Hurting the Church\u0022 by Katelyn Beaty (2022). The celebrity status of certain brothers/families has long troubled some close to me, and is, I believe, a main problem in the current (and historical) troubling situation in \u0022the church,\u0022 about which I have been speaking out. I mention in this video that Witness Lee and Philip Lee had such a dangerous and damaging celebrity status, but so do my father-in-law and my husband and many other highly regarded leading ones, in the same church community, to varying degrees, but to enough of a degree that what typical people would not get away with, they have, due to identification, \u0022love,\u0022 admiration, devotion... of many in public, while there is, behind closed doors, anger, abuse of power, cruel treatment of close family members, secrecy, giving in to temptation, and in some cases, addiction.\n\nI failed in this video to read aloud a paragraph (among many paragraphs) about Billy Graham, whom Beaty faithfully critiques regarding his celebrity status, but whose ministry was preserved due to a strict pact he made with his co-workers, the \u0022Modesto Manifesto,\u0022 to guard against common temptations. She writes (p. 38): \u0022Graham saw with prescient wisdom how intoxicating it would be for leaders to believe they are so important that they can evade accountability they need, even and perhaps especially when their work seems crucial for the kingdom. He saw that celebrity power\u0027s central lie is that an individual is important enough to be above the rules. He saw that celebrity so easily leads Christian leaders to use ministry to seek personal riches and thus defy the Bible\u0027s many warnings against greed and the love of money. He saw that celebrity causes many leaders to believe that they  can go it alone - that their individual ministries and platforms are more important and central than the  ordinary witness of local churches. And he saw that celebrity entices leaders to fudge the truth....\u0022\n\nSo applicable. Thank God for brothers who have cared, and who still care, for what went/goes on behind closed doors, even more than what is seen in public.",

Without these primary sources, trusting believers could be (and have been) more easily lied to and manipulated. We believers should not lie, nor protect lies, nor love lies  (Rev. 22:15). We love God, we love and obey His Word, we love our brothers without partiality, we abhor what is evil, and we rejoice in the truth.\n\nIn this video, I mainly read a letter written by brother Paul Kerr to K. Robichaux and R. Kangas in February 1990, just 2 months after the publication of the book \u0022A Response to Recent Accusations\u0022 - a defaming book aimed at belittling and tearing down a faithful, godly older brother\u0027s testimony to the flock under his care of why, after decades as a leading one, as a primary laborer with Witness Lee on the church hymnal and the Recovery Version of the New Testament, he needed to resign from the eldership in Anaheim. \n\nI am so thankful for all of those who spoke out and especially whose words are in print, who express the same desperate concerns I share, with a heart for the oneness of the unique Body of Christ, which \u0022Body\u0022 is NOT equivalent to those who identify as \u0022the Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022/\u0022the local churches\u0022, not restricted to adherents of Witness Lee - but comprised of all genuine believers in Christ.  \n\nThe open letter by Paul Kerr can be viewed at: www.johningalls.com/ARTRA/PaulKerrOnTheBody.pdf\n\n#johningalls\n#localchurch \n#lordsrecovery \n#thelordsrecovery \n#thelocalchurch",

I want oneness and peace, and I believe so do countless of my brothers and sisters who have reached out for fellowship about deeply offensive and wounding practices, behaviors and words too common among leaders in \u0022the Lord\u0027s Recovery.\u0022 Others desiring peace and oneness have been driven away by the cruel abuse experienced or witnessed in the church, and never spoke out publicly. I know many. And, yes, I put quotes around \u0022the Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022, because I don\u0027t believe my Lord would treat my brothers and sisters the way they have been and are being treated by many leaders in \u0022the\u0022 church, and anything abusive should never be called \u0022Recovery\u0022. So I ask you brothers, as you asked John Ingalls at the end of your book: \u0022We invite our brother[s] to treat this matter seriously and to take that proper biblical and human course of action that will produce genuine peace between [themselves] and the Body.\u0022 Many members of the Body have been and are extremely stumbled by the lack of accountability, the lack of righteousness, justice, and love toward ALL members - without partiality. Instead, there has been falsehood, gaslighting, mockery, sexual misconduct, financial corruption, defaming and despising of believers.... and I am asking that all of this get cleared up through repentance.",

I was an award -winning trainee (that\u2019s another topic\u2026). And I was the victim of multiple instances of abuse. \n\nI\u2019ve been accused of waiting until the other \u201Cparties\u201D died to speak out. I wasn\u2019t ready to speak out and lose (nearly) everything until, due to my marital crisis and the lack of effective help from responsible ones, I lost my church community and nearly everything else anyway. \n\nSome of my abusers are still alive. I wrote them emails, pleading for fellowship and reconciliation. I\u2019ve been lied about, lied to (and told when I point it out that I\u2019m on the \u201Cwrong tree\u201D), stonewalled, my personal female cycle discussed among elders and coworkers with my husband, falsely accused of various mental and emotional disorders\u2026 all because I tried to open up lines of communication, to get help, to fulfill my role as the counterpart of my husband in my home\u2026. \n\nI failed in restoring my marriage, but I was forced to look at the bigger picture, and have found that my marriage is in microcosm of a much bigger system of error.\n\nMy email is ruthewise@gmail.com. \n\nIf I spoke publicly about you in any of my videos, please know you are in good company if you are a sinner who repents. You can join all of us who can pray Psalm. 51 together and mean it.\n\nIf you are living and living lies, I hope you\u2019d be freed. \n\nIf you think that some are exempt from being accountable because of some position of authority, that\u2019s a big part of the problem.

      "description": "This video focuses on the continuation of corrupt financial practices that began in China with Watchman Nee. Churches in Taiwan and other countries in the Far East suffered similarly, and then the corruption continued in the United States. \n\nIt is a worthy endeavor to support Christian laborers, but there should be righteous handling of finances with transparency and accountability. Financial management and decisions should not be corrupt or illegal nor covered up by teachings related to covering brothers and submitting to deputy authority. \n\nSome in \u201Cthe Lord\u2019s Recovery\u201D are excessively wealthy, while others are in dire poverty. Leading brothers typically enjoy significant salaries and comfortable lifestyles, with protection from any accountability under the teaching of \u201CGod\u2019s government.\u201D Sadly, the most wealthy in the church seem also to enjoy special treatment, in my observation. And the needy ones, who still hand everything over to the God they live and serve, are blessed if tree from the love of money, but are too often abused while being expected to submit to \u201Cauthority.\u201D \n\nAnd if Christians speak out, related to matters that provoke their conscience, or if it gets too painful and unsustainable for victims of spiritual, marital, and/or financial abuse, believers in this group may appeal to the legal process, and be driven into deep debt or bankruptcy, seeking justice. \n\n#witnesslee #lordsrecovery #thelocalchurch #localchurch #livingstreamministry #thelordsrecovery #religiousabuse #cultrecovery #loveofmoney",

Their objective letter is corroborated by all the brothers labeled as \u201Crebellious\u201D in the book The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion. \n\nThat CRI article can be viewed at lcinfo.org/?page=writings/media/turmoil.\n\nYet in 1993 and again in 1996, elders in the church in Anaheim wrote letters of apology to Phillip Lee. These 9 brothers signed a letter stating that they \u201Cdo not believe that the public declaration of those three brothers concerning Philip Lee was justified or proper.\u201D\n\nI don\u2019t know of any apology or repentance from Philip. But elders asked him for forgiveness. Did the elders feel to protect sheep being molested by Philip Lee? No one reached out to me for 30 years, though my name was mentioned by a witness as a victim. What is not proper about publicly reproving an elder after receiving reports from multiple witnesses? (1 Tim. 5:20 says,  \u201C\uFFFCAs for those who persist in sin, rebuke them\uFFFC in the presence of all, so the rest may stand in fear.\u201D) How is rebuking a serial sexual predator in a church not justifiable or proper?

      "description": "I recently read on a forum that my videos kind of all say the same thing, or something like that. Forgive me for any wordiness or repetition. \n\nWhat am I hoping for in posting these videos\u2026 so feeble and too repetitive and unimpressively simple? \n\nWhat have dozens of sincere, devout believers hoped for, who have raised awareness - or tried to- of patterns of sinning in \u201CThe Lord\u2019s Recovery\u201D and of the covering up of those sins?\n\nI have heard a highly respected (that in itself being problematic...)\u0022senior co-worker\u0022 mocking an older brother who  confronted Brother Lee about some of the gross sins being covered up.  The \u0022senior coworker\u0022  mimicked how that elderly brother said he had to \u0022deeeaal with his conscience\u0022 (lowering his voice very deeply like that faithful brother\u0027s voice) - making a joke about such a phrase and scorning the brother. Dealing with our conscience is not something to mock. It is essential to keep the oneness and for us to properly love one another - the new commandment, by  which all men know that we are Jesus\u0027 disciples.\n\nI hope these videos and my blog (inconvenientruth.com) would join with the voices of many other dear and faithful believers who have not been able to remain silent about intolerable and unreal with sins. Many voices were silenced. Many who\u2019ve spoken out have been publicly shamed and lied about. Such ones face spiritual abuse. Many have lost precious friends and family members due to misrepresentation. \n\nBut silence is not an option once one\u2019s conscience is provoked, when the Lord in us is turning over tables in what should be house of prayer, but has become a den of thieves (Matt. 21:13; Mark 11:17; Luke 19:46). \n\nThe goal of every single video and every single blog I post is \u201Clove, which comes from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith\u201D (1 Tim. 1:5). \n\nTo have healthy love for one another, we need a pure heart and a good conscience and sincere faith. I learned as a little child how to take care of my conscience and it\u2019s something that no believer should ever graduate from. \n\nI pray that any involved would humble ourselves and pray and seek God\u2019s face and turn from our wicked ways, that God would hear and forgive and heal our land (2 Chron. 7:14).\n\n#localchurch \n#witnesslee \n#lordsrecovery \n#spiritualabuse\n#denofrobbers",

      "description": "This is another painful and heavy video to record and post, but unless we deal with the pattern of sinning and covering up sins in \u201CThe Lord\u2019s Recovery,\u201D we are not honoring God\u2019s Word. \n\nGod is not a respecter of persons, nor should we be.\n\nIn this video I review a book in a very brief way. The book is My Unforgettable Memories- Watchman Nee\u0026 Shanghai Local Church. The author was a young sister in the church with Watchman Nee. She did extensive research to verify her accounts, which include many eyewitness accounts and letters. There are many witnesses of gross sins committed by Watchman Nee throughout decades in China. The only reason anyone would refuse to believe this to be at least possible, refuse to hear multiple witnesses and refuse to address a long history of damaging practices, including a person being called a \u201Ddelegate [or deputy] authority\u201D being unquestionable and unaccountable, is that we have made some leaders idols - not humans like the rest of us including King David who are not above sinning - and not above being rebuked and openly repenting. \n\nDon\u2019t excommunicate me for speaking my concerns. I am deeply concerned partly because I am a direct victim of sexual immorality practiced and covered up in the Lords recovery, that has yet to be addressed by anyone in leadership, although several knew about it over 35 years ago. And I am aware of many more cases. And we should repent for idolizing anyone\u2026 even a \u201CMinister of the Age.\u201D",

In my youth this didn\u2019t sound right. It sounded controlling, diminishing and limiting of all the members of the church, each with their precious portions and experiences and light from God\u2019s Word. \n\nOne may reason such things away, justifying them by various verses like Paul saying to the Philippians that we should all speak the same thing. But he didn\u2019t charge them to say only what he said. I\u2019ve heard the exposition that Paul means we should all speak Christ - the multifaceted, unsearchable, measureless riches of Christ and goodness of God\u2026 and we need eternity for that. NOT as tape recorders but as those with a personal knowing and seeing of Christ and all the riches in God\u2019s Word.\n\nTo have an attitude that we can only speak with another person, a leader, has spoken can very easily become culty - controlling, and totalitarian, etc.\n\nI am off to meet with believers, but thought I would post this for fellowship among anyone who wants to participate.

      "description": "Without partiality and favoritism I feel to keep speaking out about multiple cases in which responsible ones in the Local Church and in \u201CThe Lord\u2019s Recovery\u201D did not deal properly with sins. These are not victimless sins. They damage the hearts and families of targets and victims. The damage can extend even for generations. The damage doesn\u2019t disappear or heal with silence, but through applying God\u2019s Word faithfully, which involves rebuking and reproving, in the case of leading ones, publicly, and they\u2019re being repentance and forgiveness.\n\nThe practice in the Lords recovery has been to publicly rebuke people who speak out, and to quarantine them and label them as poisonous and negative. I am not poisonous or negative. I can\u2019t tolerate these patterns in what is being called \u201CThe Lord\u2019s Recovery.\u201D Lives are being destroyed. \n\nBrothers, what is the motive of stank silent about these improprieties and sins? Is it because of partiality towards certain families? Is it because of financial gain that may be affected if people hold you accountable? \n\nWe live before the Lord. It is better to deal with offenses and sins in this age, while we are still on our way home to meet the Lord.\n\nI\u2019d like to add, related the sexual abuse my daughter experienced from a son of Ben Phillips, Jr.:\n\n1) Brother Ben, when you made that appeal at your dad\u2019s memorial for those who have \u201Cleft\u201D to \u201Ccome back\u201D - brother, if we left a particular gathering of believers because we weren\u2019t safe, we weren\u2019t protected by leaders, and we were ignored and/or shamed if we spoke out, how/why would we return to that environment? And I refuse to call such an environment \u201Cthe\u201D church\u2026. Yes, the church in Corinth had problems, but hopefully they were dealt with properly and thoroughly by leaders. Eventually their testimony faded. Eventually the lampstand was removed from the church in Ephesus. You can have the right name but not be the reality of a church as a lampstand. \n\n2) I am not speaking about this matter to shame any minors in the church. They need care and shepherding and protection and guidance from the older ones. Both my daughter and this other young person, were suffering, deep depression and family-related pain. They found a lot of solace in being together and talking honestly together. But personal boundaries should always be honored. When my daughter asked for help, help could\u2019ve been given, but her appeals were ignored.\n\n3) To Christy\u2019s grandparents, Willie and Rosalind Wise, she opened to you about her being molested. You told her to not say anything about it, but to cover the family. You should have protected your granddaughter (or any other victim opening to you) - not the image of a high profile family. We should protect every victim of sexual violence, assault, and harassment, without partiality or favoritism.\n\nTo all, this is a PATTERN in \u201CThe Lord\u2019s Recovery\u201D and it is not sustainable. There needs to be proper rebuking and repenting and forgiveness and restoration in cases such as those I mention in this video. \n\n#thelocalchurch \n#lordsrecovery",

      "description": "In this video, I speak out about a member of my spiritual family, who has not been shepherded properly to repent and to be restored to the fellowship, but rather his sins that have stumbled many, and his disappearance that grieves even more of us, are all covered up and \u0022not spoken about\u0022 (except in small circles). This is contrary to GOD\u0027S Word, which says, \u0022Do not entertain an accusation against an elder unless it is brought by two or three witnesses. But those elders who are sinning you are to reprove before everyone, so that the others may take warning.  I charge you, in the sight of God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels, to keep these instructions without partiality, and to do nothing out of favoritism\u0022 (I Tim. 5:19-21).\n\nI am just a \u0022little\u0022 (53-year-old) sister but I can\u0027t bear the lack of practicing what is in God\u0027s Word, in the name of \u0022covering brothers,\u0022 in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery.\u0022 What about protecting endangered wives? What about comforting heart-broken children and grandchildren? What about loving one another enough to reprove publicly, for there to be public warning and public repentance and full forgiveness and restoration?\n\nThere should be no favoritism, no partiality. If you rebuke brothers publicly who are maintaining a clean conscience, speaking truthfully, but whose speaking may tarnish the reputation of an individual or an organization, but you are covering up gross sins of leading brothers, trying to hide the truth, that is partiality.\n\nAs long as I am alive, I won\u0027t stand by, but I will speak up and speak out the truth... the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God. We are ALL affected by lies in our communities and especially in the church (composed of ALL believers), including lies of ommission, and by the loss of the function of fellow members who fall into sin or are excommunicated for speaking up about sins that need to be dealt with scripturally.\n\nTo the brother I address, and to his family, I hope you receive my words in this public way only from my heart of love and my deep desire for restoration and for preservation of the Lord\u0027s testimony and genuine oneness, apart from sin, among ALL His believers, wherever and with whomever we may be practically meeting.\n\nLove finds no joy in unrighteousness but rejoices in the truth (1 Cor. 13:6).\n\n#lordsrecovery \n#thelocalchurch \n#witnesslee \n#cultrecovery",

Our oneness should not depend on any special affiliation to one particular ministry and the exclusion of others\u0027 ministries.\n\nAnd we should not use godliness as a means for financial gain (1 Tim. 6:5).\n\nIf a church (\u0022THE church\u0022) is required to have/speak/read only \u0022one ministry,\u0022 based on one or two brothers\u0027 speaking, and a non-profit publishing company is very enmeshed with THE church, financially and practically, and that publishing company sells only those two brothers\u0027 writings, there is a huge incentive to silence anything that would cause serious, legitimate and scriptural concerns among followers regarding the publishing company, the churches, and especially leading ones including the \u0022commander\u0022 (Elders Training Book 7, 1986, bibleread.online/all-books-by-Watchman-Nee-and-Witness-Lee/book-elders-training-book-07-one-accord-for-the-lords-move-Witness-Lee-read-online/6/).\n\n[From that same Elders Training book just cited, here are 2 pertinent paragraphs I didn\u0027t read in the  video:\n\n\u0022Some saints came to me a number of times with reports concerning serious and even negative situations. They may have misunderstood my not responding to them with any kind of seriousness. I believe I did not respond in this way not only out of my patience and toleration but also because of the Lord\u2019s wisdom. I feel that it is altogether wise to be patient. When the fruit of a particular tree is growing, the fruit itself will show what it is. When the fruit becomes ripe, it will fall from the tree. At this point, however, I do not feel that I should tolerate certain situations any longer, because enough damage has been done already. I do not like to see more damage done to the Lord\u2019s recovery. I have no time, dear saints, to fool around with people any longer. Let us go to fight the battle. Who are the \u201Cus\u201D? They are the ones who are desperate with no opinion.\n\nand...\n\u0022It is altogether not wise for you to remain in the recovery taking this ministry on the one hand and yet on the other hand to say something else. This is not wise. It is not profitable to yourself or to your future. You may say that you have a ministry, but this is not profitable to your ministry if you have one. You can never profit your ministry in the future in this way. Rather, you have dispensed your future in a cheap way. The wise way is to stay, without any opinion, with the recovery, which is unique.\u0022]\n\nIf there is abuse in THE church and/or in the Ministry office of the publication company, to remain \u0022faithful\u0022 in the church and \u0022faithful to the ministry\u0022  - or \u0022one with the ministry\u0022  - seems to require that you look the other way rather than confront and deal with stumbling sin. Such \u0022oneness\u0022 of \u0022the Body\u0022 is actually a loyalism to a corrupt system/organization with a financial conflict of interest. \n\nI don\u0027t do justice in this video (nor in any video)... but hopefully this is a start.\n\nAdd to this the fact that much money is brought in by the activities of the Living Stream Ministry that supports many \u0022faithful to the ministry.\u0022 What if such ones were to say, \u0022Sin is not acceptable. Sexual harrassment is illegal and should be dealt with seriously.\u0022 Would they lose their financial support? Would they be shunned?\n\nOh, wait, this happened. And such ones were labeled \u0022rebellious\u0022 and \u0022poisonous\u0022 and lied about and excommunicated (\u0022quarantined\u0022).\n\nWe were cheated from their ministry - which I believe each and every member of Christ\u0027s body has.\n\nOur oneness must not depend on oneness with anyone other than the Triune God. If it is, we are very likely in a cult.\n\n#witnesslee \n#lordsrecovery \n#thelocalchurch \n#cultrecovery",

Very trained therapists I have had have said that minimally, I have been treated in cult-like ways over the years... and I know this to be true. I watched \u0022Scientology and Its Aftermath\u0022 with tears streaming down my face during some episodes, being able to identify with victims speaking out, or of whom others were speaking. As believers and as doers of God\u0027s Word, cult-like behaviors should not be characteristic of our practices.\n\nIn this video, I mainly read from a webpage of an international authority on cults, Janja Lalich (janjalalich.com/help/characteristics-associated-with-cults/).\n\nI also make a few feeble comments with a few examples of experiences, practices and observations that align to these characteristics, practiced in \u0022The Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022/\u0022The Local Churches\u0022. If I said more, and I have a lot more to say, the video would get too long.\n\nFor many, including myself for many years, it is hard to hear these words until/unless you reach a point in your life where destructive treatment directed at you or at someone you love is no longer bearable... then in order to heal, you begin to face the facts and to think soberly and, yes, critically, about your community, your choices (or lack thereof), the consequences of your choices, and how all of that compares to the characteristics of cults.",

      "description": "Dear fellow believers, if I and others are speaking the truth, because as lovers of God and of His church, we can no longer be silent , are we \u0022opposers\u0022? Believers doing all we can to fight for God\u0027s pure testimony are being smeared and silenced and stonewalled, accused of spreading unfounded rumors and false accusations. Maybe writers of this article are not considering me and other lovers of Jesus as such opposers - then wonderful! Please, let\u0027s meet and fellowship. I believe many like myself have been and are certainly \u0022misunderstood\u0022. The article I am addressing begins with the words, \u0022No one likes to be misunderstood...\u0022 referring to those \u0022in the Lord\u0027s Recovery\u0022. To the writers of this article, I address this video. Have you sought to accurately understand ones you have labeled as opposers? If not, perhaps THEY are being misunderstood? Perhaps they  are 100% open to understanding if in any way they have misunderstood anything or anyone. We believers can expect misunderstanding, but we should do our best to be at peace with ALL men, and should not tolerate immorality and gross sins, covered up with dishonesty and hypocrisy, in the context what is being called \u0022the church.\u0022 We should judge the sin, confess and repent of it, and love one another warmly, allowing no division.",
