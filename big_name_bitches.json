      "description": "This week on Big Name B*tches, we\u2019re chatting with actress, comedian, and content creator Manon Mathews. Manon was an early star on Vine, where her hilarious videos reached over 1 billion views. She opens up about everything from her love of self-help programs (or are they cults?), experiences with ayahuasca, and getting clear on what she wants right now. Plus, the ladies discuss what it\u2019s really like to work on SNL, the time Christy tried Scientology, and Manon\u2019s book Funny How It Works Out.\u00A0  Did Anneliese go to school with NXIVM leader Allison Mack? Did Christy\u2019s OBGYN tell her she was fat? What\u2019s it like to work on a Disney cruise?
