Our conversation was all over the place, but she reveals things she has never said before. I asked her a lot of questions, but there was still a lot more to be asked. This interview is very heavy to watch, so I am warning you now. With all that being said, please share your thoughts. \n\nhttps://linktr.ee/colbyjryan\n\nBecome a member! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNLV4owf3PC9hCEuqd8qeeg/join",
