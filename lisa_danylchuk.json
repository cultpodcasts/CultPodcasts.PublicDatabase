      "description": "Traumatic Narcissism and Cult Dynamics With Dan Shaw\n\nIn this episode of the How We Can Heal Podcast, host Lisa Danylchuk welcomes Daniel Shaw, a psychotherapist trained in psychoanalysis and trauma-informed therapies, to discuss traumatic narcissism and cult dynamics. Daniel shares his personal journey from being an actor early in life to becoming a member of what he discovered over time was a spiritual cult. Today he shares how these experiences spurred his interest in trauma, and why he coined the term \u0022traumatizing narcissist\u0022. He elaborates on the behaviors and characteristics of traumatizing narcissists, the impact on their victims, and how these dynamics can manifest in various relationships and institutions. They also touch on the importance of recognizing these abusive patterns for effective therapy and recovery.
