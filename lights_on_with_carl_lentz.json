My choices, and the road toward recovery taught me how helpful it is to have people share vulnerably the impact of their bad choices, the pain they caused, and the pain they suffered that led them to make those choices, and what they\u2019ve discovered can be helpful and healing. My hope is that in sharing those things from my story and asking others to share theirs, it will be helpful, hopeful and healing. I\u2019m thankful for where we are today. To be confident of the future, content in the present and healed enough to speak to the past is miraculous. If we can make it, anybody can\u2026thank you for all the love and support!",
