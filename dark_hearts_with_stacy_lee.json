      "description": "The controversial world of Mormons and polygamy collide in this explosive episode of the best true crime podcast you can\u0027t miss! Is there a connection between billionaire David Neeleman\u0027s son and the FLDS? Is Hannah Neeleman, wife of JetBlue founder David Neeleman, secretly involved in a modern-day Mormon cult? As we peel back the layers of these religious cults, we ask: Are these true crime stories more than they appear? \n\nFrom the infamous Tom Green polygamist to the hidden compounds of polygamist groups, we journey through the dark underbelly of Mormonism and its offshoots. Famous cult leaders, secret ceremonies, and the struggle against oppressive traditions \u2013 it\u0027s all here in this gripping episode. With insider knowledge from Stacy\u0027s own Mormon upbringing, this episode delves deep into conspiracy theories surrounding these secretive communities. Join host Stacy Lee as she navigates the treacherous waters of Mormon cults and uncovers the Hannah Neeleman drama that\u0027s set the internet ablaze.
