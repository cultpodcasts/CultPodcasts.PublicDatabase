While I know that the title of this episode may sound like I want to take on the whole affirmation community (if that is a thing), that is not the case. I do believe there is a missing step in the process of how we have been taught to do affirmations. So, this week, I want to teach you the missing piece and speed up the process of getting you to what you want to believe about yourself. This way you get to where you want to go with your life a whole lot quicker! If nothing else, you get to the beliefs you want to believe in a more holistic, moving way, sustainable way.",

I worked as a waitress at the diner. In this week\u0027s episode of The Unorthodox Woman, I recount a remarkable encounter with a charming lady who happened to be working alongside me. While I can\u0027t recall her exact age or even remember her name, she appeared to be in her late 60s or maybe even 70s. (as a 20-year-old, she seemed \u0022old\u0022 to me at the time.) Little did I know that she would impart a lesson that has stayed with me for over 30 years. It involves coffee, a beverage I was not allowed to drink as an active believing member of my church. I have a feeling this story will help you with whatever you are struggling with, as it has helped me with my own struggles throughout my life.",

      "description": "Happy Pride, Wildflowers! June is a special month, filled with vibrant rainbows that illuminate our communities. It\u0027s a time when we come together to celebrate and show our unwavering support for our queer friends. However, it\u0027s important to acknowledge that not everyone shares the same level of acceptance and love. This reality reinforces the significance of celebrating and uplifting the voices of our queer loved ones. As allies, we have a responsibility to stand beside them, amplifying their experiences and advocating for their rights. It is crucial that we make conscious choices with our resources, ensuring we don\u0027t support organizations that oppose equality. One powerful way to become a better ally and understand the struggles faced by the LGBTQIA\u0026#43; community is through education. By learning about the rich history of the LGBTQ movement in the United States, we gain invaluable insights into the progress that has been made and the challenges that remain. This history is a tapestry woven with the resilience, courage, and determination of countless individuals who fought for their rights and the rights of future generations. In this week\u0027s episode, we embark on a journey through time to explore key players and events that have shaped and propelled the fight for equality in the LGBTQIA\u0026#43; movement in our country. By delving into these stories, we can deepen our understanding of the struggles faced by the community, the milestones achieved, and the ongoing work that lies ahead. Each chapter in this history reveals the strength and spirit of a community that refused to be silenced, pushing boundaries and demanding recognition. From the Stonewall Riots in 1969, where transgender women of color led the charge against police brutality and ignited a global movement, to the activism of Harvey Milk, the first openly gay elected official in California, who championed LGBTQ rights until his tragic assassination - these stories serve as reminders of the power of collective action and the transformative impact it can have. Learning about the LGBTQ movement\u0027s history fosters empathy, compassion, and a deeper appreciation for the progress we\u0027ve made while acknowledging the work that remains. It allows us to challenge prejudice and discrimination, inspiring us to create inclusive spaces where all individuals can live authentically and without fear. By embracing the past, we pave the way for a more equitable future. So let us honor the struggles and celebrate the triumphs of the LGBTQIA\u0026#43; movement by educating ourselves, elevating diverse voices, and standing alongside our queer friends with unwavering support and love. Happy Pride, Wildflowers!",

We will be unlearning a lot of what has contributed to a constricted way of thinking and living. You get to create your own personal renaissance and it all starts now! What do you want that to look like? How many iterations of yourself do you want to have fun exploring? What areas of life do you find yourself stuck in even tho you have left a lot of your past ways of thinking and feeling behind? These are all issues we will be discussion on the podcast.

There is healing in telling/sharing your story, it can be freeing in just doing that, sharing, telling your story to a therapist or friend. Does your story come out the same way again and again? Do you judge yourself for not having \u0022healed\u0022 faster? Is there a time limit on when you are supposed to be healed? In this episode I deep dive into the concept of healing and what we think it should look like and what healing actually looks like AND how you can be an active participant to your own healing, possibly speeding up the process. If you feel like you are on an emotional roller coaster of emotions all the time or that your healing is taking way too long, then this episode of Exmormonology is a very important one for you to listen to Wildflower.",

Tune in as we talk about how unraveling your mormon brain takes time, years actually. What is the strangest place your mormon brain has shown up on this side of life? Seriously post mormon humor is one of my most favorite things. Laughter is really the key piece to your healing. When you get to the place of laughter, you know you are on the right track.

You know that Exmormonology is all about helping you heal and work through religious trauma. Healing is not linear. It has ups and downs and joy and pain. Come be a fly on the wall while we discuss it all. Emily had her initial faith crisis in 2019 and has spent the last several years working through the tough issues that we all have to work through in finding our way back to ourselves, after the world as we knew it comes crashing down around us. You, wildflower, are not alone on this journey. Keep going. Keep healing. Keep showing up for yourself.",

      "description": "I am excited to share with all y\u0027all wildflowers a conversation I have with my friend and fellow coach Allison Crow. Allison just released her new book Unarmored: Finding Home in the Wild Edges of Being Human. Allison was raised a devout Christian in the south, Texas. Although not raised mormon, Allison has experienced her own faith crisis. I know you will love our discussion and we ebb and flow about life and heartbreak and healing and busting out of the \u0022being a made up woman my religion taught me to be,\u0022 type of thinking. Allison Crow, M.Ed, is a Life and Self-Leadership coach for small business owners and executives. She has been leading, teaching, speaking, writing, creating, and coaching in one form or another since the mid-1990s. For years, she was a hard-lined performance and sales coach motivated by outside forces and an excruciating need for approval. Now, instead of being driven by hard financial goals and lifeless quotas, Allison has an unconventional and connected practice where delicious and thought provoking conversations are centered around meeting yourself deeply. She helps her clients compassionately work with emotions, thoughts, and behaviors that are natural but often bypassed parts of our human selves. Allison specializes in IFS-informed coaching, deep inner work, creative expression, and building the skills of courageous emotional presence and self-trust. Allison lives in the hill country outside of Austin, Texas, with her husband of fifteen years and her rescued dogs, Leroy Brown and Clementine. She is often seen with a stack of journals, a paintbrush and watercolors, with her phone in her hand, creating and connecting on social media, or floating in the backyard pool she calls her \u201Cchurch.\u201D WWW.ALLISONCROW.COM https://allisoncrow.com/unarmoredthebook/",

I tap into some pretty tender emotions and I want to share them with you in hopes that you can relate and see and hear what healing sounds like. Healing does not mean you have landed at the top of healing mountain where rainbows and butterflies live forever and ever and you dance around in gleeful joy and you no longer feel grief, pain or heartache. It means that you learn to hold the space for the tender side of healing and you do not make it mean that anything has gone wrong or that you are not healing. Healing ebbs and flows. Healing takes time. Remember wildflower, there is no rush and no race to this process. Just you and all the time you need. Thank you for letting me walk this path with you. Grab a cup a something and a blanket and maybe even a tissue and let\u0027s talk, you and me.",

I had signs along the way, relating to the church, but my brain was not ready to see it. Much like marketing and needing to see/hear something 7 times or more before we start making connections about certain issues or products or ? I want you to start looking for other areas of your life where you can maybe short cut this process. What are you not believing about yourself that you need a few nudges to see yourself in a different light, just like seeing the church in a different light? What areas of your life can you make similar paradigm shifts? Let\u2019s talk about it this week on Exmormonology.",

You will need time to process your emotions and then you will need to figure out how to create new thoughts that help you out of hopelessness. New thoughts that keep you out of stuckville. You are capable of doing this, it is possible. It is okay if right now you are in shock and feel overwhelming depressed and angry. I understand these emotions, we dance together often.

And the Author of \u2018What I Wish: 100 love notes to help you survive, come alive, and thrive after abortion.\u2019 After her own unanticipated abortion as a mother of three, she recognized the need for a wider conversation around the complex emotional landscape of life after abortion. She reminds her audience that it\u2019s okay to feel all the feelings after abortion, and that we can honor our decisions by living the life we made our choice for.

No other person gets to determine how you think and feel about yourself. Once you learn how to take full responsibility for your thoughts and emotions, you become unstoppable. Before you tell yourself this is too hard, just be open to believing this is possible for you. That is where you start, with the belief that it is possible. This is why what you think about yourself matters way more than what anyone else thinks of you.",

This week I want to share some of the personal pieces of my post mormon story as it relates to self pleasure, free falling in Hollywood, and figuring out some things about my sexual stereotypes and how sometimes we have to stumble around in the dark to figure it all out. We have talked about how we, as exmormons, initially feel very infantile as we remove the rose colored glasses from our existence, here on Exmormonology. Giving yourself permission to explore and figure things our for yourself is a huge piece of your healing. It can be hard with the thought that contribute to guilt and shame. Let\u0027s bust through that together.",

Your overall generalized anxiety is most likely caused from all of the emotions you are not wanting to sit with and feel all the way through.

God and The Holy of Holies, a spot for God and Jesus. Kolob, near Kolob. Amy reeealllly loves this wine. GenExers putting the X in Exmo. A different mormonism now??? The church morphing into mainstream christianity. Finding ourselves defending mormonism to outsiders who do not know what they are talking about. Weird in so many ways.

I know it can feel like you are stagnant tho, as you process all that you are going through.
