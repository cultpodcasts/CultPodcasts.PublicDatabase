      "description": "This video is about the chilling crime against Jimmy Prout, a 45-year-old man from North Shields who was subjected to a campaign of abuse over months and ultimately killed by a group of individuals who were part of a cult-like group.This case raises the question: Was this a cult? In this video, we will explore the formation of the group, the dynamics of the cult, and the heinous acts committed against Jimmy Prout. \n\nWe will examine the manipulation that led to Jimmy\u0027s tragic demise, the role of the group\u0027s leader, Zahid Zaman, 43, and the involvement of other members, including Ann Corbett, 26, Myra Wood, 45, and Kay Rayworth, 56.We will also discuss the missed opportunities to save Jimmy Prout and the trial that followed, which saw Zaman and Corbett convicted of murder, while Rayworth and Wood were convicted of causing or allowing the death of a vulnerable adult.So, was this a cult?\n--\nWant to support the channel? \nLeave me a tip: https://ko-fi.com/thethinveil\n\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/The_Thin_Veil\n\nYour support means everything.\n\nI try my best to upload once a fortnight but also have other obligations.\n\n--\n0:00 Introduction\n2:16 Jimmy Prout\n4:16 Zahid Zaman\n7:00 Background of North Shields \u0027cult\u0027\n10:03 Group Dynamics\n11:27 Torture of Jimmy Prout\n14:54 CCTV footage and demise of Jimmy Prout\n17:10 The plot against Ann Corbett and sentencing\n18:22 Missed opportunities to save Jimmy Prout\n19:20 Was this a cult?\n--\nI always do my best to fact-check everything and ensure the sources I use are trustworthy but humans are infallible, articles can be inaccurate and truths can change over time.
