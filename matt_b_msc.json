After having a family, seeking out mental health support, having a religious epiphany at a roadside and then leaving Mormonism, Shawn found a way to develop empathy and grow a conscience. He is living proof that sociopathy need not be permanent.\n\nThis interview is part of a series titled \u0027Sociopathy: An Option Undiscovered\u0027 (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLw52gGEoMGlD9qfC_iBgcJPoYsqTkLcq) where  cases such as Shawn\u0027s are presented to the public.\n\nI reached out to Shawn after Shawn revealed some of his history on the podcast Mormon Stories, and I began the task of documenting his life story. We are currently producing a book titled \u0022Sociopathy: An Option Undiscovered: The Ground-Breaking Case of Shawn McCraney\u0022 which will compile our transcribed interviews, contributions from Shawn\u0027s family and friends, along with expert commentary from academic researchers, professionals and clinicians. Our hope is to contribute to the clinical study and societal understanding of anti-social personality disorder.
