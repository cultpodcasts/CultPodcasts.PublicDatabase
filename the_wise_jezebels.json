Jill\u2019s memoir is not only the story of how Sweet Jilly Muffin found her voice against the IBLP and her exploitive, oppressive parents\u2013it also offers a window into the Christian Patriarchy\u2019s teachings about how children are to honor their parents even as married adults. We break down the red flags for abuse we found in the book, as well as what goes into writing trauma-memoirs. From there, Tia and Laura Pop Into Pop Culture with a look at the Jonas divorce and the lewd conduct of Lauren Boebart. Our Non-Consenual Advice segment answers a listener\u2019s question\u2013How do I tell my Catholic parents I don\u2019t want to baptize my children?\u00A0 \u00A0 Speaking of that segment\u2026 If you have questions for the Wise Jezebels, head to the contact form on our website or send us a DM and we\u2019ll answer them on the pod (after removing all identifying information, of course!) \u00A0 Stay fresh, betches! \u00A0 The views and opinions expressed by the hosts of the Wise Jezebels are their own.

      "description": "Welcome to the FIRST episode of the Wise Jezebels\u2026a podcast where we discuss pop culture, relevant topics, fundamentalism, and check the fruit! And we are no-holds-barred! We jump right in to talking about our experiences visiting the gynecologist after growing up in a system that taught us abstinence-only sex-education and even discouraged us from using tampons for fear of having any contact with your private parts! Tia and Laura share what they\u2019ve learned since then about their bodies, what some of their current frustrations are, and how they are navigating female health on the outside of high control religion. They also discuss their thoughts on the Danny Masterson case and why Scientology plays such a huge role and answer a listener question in their \u2018Non-Consensual Advice\u2019 segment!
