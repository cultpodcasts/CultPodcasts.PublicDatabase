      "description": "When I was still in \u0022MLM\u0022 in 2021, I would never have believed you if had you told me that less than 2 years later, I\u0027d be an antimlm activist and would be interviewing Robert Fitzpatrick (author of False Profits, Ponzinomics and Direct Selling a Nonfiction Fable) as part of my efforts to spread awareness about MLM cultic rackets.\n\nI first saw Robert on LuLaRich and as I\u0027ve mentioned in interviews, I couldn\u0027t hear him when he was speaking...it was like a brick wall came down in my mind and I had to rewind again and again in this monumental effort to try and hear him explain the phenomenon of MLM pyramid schemes.\n\nFast forward to today, I\u0027ve had therapy, made new friends and continue to heal.\n\nThe language we use to describe the fraud that is MLM is extremely important.  Cults use language to control members, and MLM is no different.  In order to accurately describe what MLM is it\u0027s important to examine what it is not.  \n\nIn this interview, Robert very clearly explains what MLM is and what it is not and why it\u0027s so important to use accurate language in speaking about these cultic rackets.  \n\nRobert\u0027s website Pyramid Scheme Alert: https://www.pyramidschemealert.org/",
