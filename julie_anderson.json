      "description": "Thank you to the antimlm movement on social media for being so supportive of me as I exited MLM and began speaking out.  It is thanks to the antimlm movement at large that many of us are even able to speak out, thank you to everyone who has helped pave the way, without your work, speaking out would be even more difficult.\n\nThank you to the continuing efforts of the antimlm movement across social media for doing the work that academics and regulators refuse to acknowledge - I can now say with certainty that the way forward lies with MLM survivors and their courage in continuing to come forward, speaking out (if they choose), writing their State Attorney Generals, boycotting MLMs.  It\u0027s up to us to spread awareness and education.  The pressure and intimidation to not speak the truth, is real.  I have seen it labeled as extremist and even implied that criticizing the FTC is \u0022anti - antimlm.\u0022  \n\nI, like so many MLM survivors, have been belittled, infantilized, dismissed, insulted, mocked, laughed at by people you would think would want to help survivors:\n\n1. \u0022Research\u0022 that claims that MLM isn\u0027t a problem in the European Union, when a simple Google search shows both Amway and Monat are present in the EU.  \n\n2. The FTC role-playing as an MLM participant attempting to recruit someone (expecting a courtesy laugh), as MLM survivors sat there and looked on.\n\n3.  An \u0022academic\u0022 presentation showing sexualized social media posts from MLM participants as cheap shock value that most academics/regulators in the room laughed at reinforcing the shame and isolation that many ex-MLM participants feel.  \n\n4. Any mention that MLM is fraud was met with a strange mantra from academics and regulators: \u0022People expect change overnight.\u0022  I have no idea who these academics are talking about or talking to, because they certainly aren\u0027t speaking with MLM survivors. \n\n5.  Absolutely no direction, clear guidance on who to contact, what reports to file, how best to word reports.  Why wasn\u0027t there a segment dedicated to this?\n\nFellow advocate, Dave Vaughan has himself put together this document with emails and websites that we can contact and send reports to:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aZbSCRCAo-s1-9ZZitDUftarepFRrnSsXyM167dW_x8/edit?usp=drivesdk\n\nThank you to fellow cult survivors for supporting me in making this speech which as you know I came very close not to delivering, because of what went on.  Thank you very much to Roberta Blevins, Dave Vaughan, Brandie Hadfield, Marco Moukhaiber, Meredith Adams, Erin Bies, Robert FitzPatrick and David Brear.\n\nTo all MLM survivors:  you are not alone.  The corruption runs deep, the gaslighting is on full force, keep speaking out!\n\nTo everyone  who supports the antimlm movement: Each comment, each video view, each conversation you have with a friend/family member raising awareness about these cultic frauds is making a difference.\n\nAnd my presentation and thoughts above are dedicated to all MLM survivors.  \n\nThank you to Brandie Hadfield for videoing this. \n#antimlm",

Cults use language to control members, and MLM is no different.  In order to accurately describe what MLM is it\u0027s important to examine what it is not.  \n\nIn this interview, Robert very clearly explains what MLM is and what it is not and why it\u0027s so important to use accurate language in speaking about these cultic rackets.  \n\nRobert\u0027s website Pyramid Scheme Alert: https://www.pyramidschemealert.org/",
