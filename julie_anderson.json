      "description": "This is alarming to me - seeing someone who specializes in cults being hired by MLMs?!  And then goes on to say they are \u0022bad MLMs\u0022 out there that are cults, but not the one I consulted for!  They were good guys!  This is absolutely wild to me that this interview is from 2 years ago. I have to wonder how many people this individual has harmed with his so called cult expert status. \n\nOriginal video from fellow YouTube creator: \n@erichunley \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBWRx1anhgM",
