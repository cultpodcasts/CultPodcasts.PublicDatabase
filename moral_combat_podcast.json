      "description": "In episode 70 of the Moral Combat Podcast, Forest Benedict, a licensed marriage and family therapist (LMFT) with a specialization in religious trauma and Internal Family Systems (IFS) therapy, shares an enlightening discussion on his transition from a Christian sex addiction therapist to embracing a broader understanding of healing through IFS. Forest opens up about his personal healing journey, which was significantly impacted by psychedelics, leading him to discover IFS therapy\u2014a method that emphasizes understanding and healing the various \u0027parts\u0027 of ourselves that have developed in response to trauma. By accessing one\u0027s authentic core self, characterized by compassion, courage, and clarity, individuals can offer wounded parts of themselves the safety needed to heal. Forest discusses the profound impact this approach has had on his life, particularly through inner child work and re-experiencing past traumas from a place of compassion. He touches on the complex nature of religious trauma, highlighting the persistence of survival behaviors long after leaving a religious context and the importance of developing self-trust and intuition. His reflections on how religious teachings may be shaped by the unhealed traumas of their authors, along with his appreciation for the courage shown by Nathaniel and Zach in addressing religious trauma through the podcast, add depth to the conversation. The hosts\u0027 gratitude for Forest\u0027s vulnerability and the safe space he creates through his own healing journey rounds out an episode that\u0027s not only professional and insightful but also deeply human and relatable.\n\nMoral Combat is a podcast hosted by siblings Nathan and Zach Blaustone.

She recounts being stalked by her ex-husband\u0027s acquaintance, a preacher\u0027s kid, who sent chilling night vision photos of her residence. Kim also shares the distressing ordeal of her yard sale sabotage and the stark realization that her community, including those she once considered family, chose the church over her. Her journey highlights the painful yet eye-opening truth about conditional support and the harsh realities she faced for not conforming to the church\u0027s expectations. This clip is a raw and powerful testament to Kim\u0027s strength in navigating through betrayal and abandonment during a pivotal moment in her life.\n\nIn Episode 65 of the Moral Combat Podcast, hosts Zach and Nathan Blaustone delve into a deep conversation with guest Kim Shambaugh, exploring the impact of religious upbringing on personal growth and healing. Raised in an evangelical Baptist family, Kim\u0027s early life was dominated by purity culture and strict religious norms. Her journey, marked by a challenging marriage and struggles with perfectionism and eating disorders, led to a transformative divorce at 26 and subsequent ostracization from her church. Finding love and acceptance with her non-religious husband, Kim moved to Ohio, where she began deconstructing her faith and embracing practices like meditation and intuitive work. Her story culminates in founding Never Settle Life, a company focused on holistic nutrition and transformation, reflecting her journey towards self-discovery and healing.\n\nFull Episode: https://youtu.be/ao703w6LSUs \n\nKim Shambaugh:\nNever Settle Life - https://www.instagram.com/neversettlelife?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D \n\nMoral Combat is a podcast hosted by siblings Nathan and Zach Blaustone.

      "description": "In this revealing episode of the Moral Combat Podcast, Jonathan Garza shares his deeply personal journey of growing up in the Seventh Day Adventist (SDA) church, a life thoroughly intertwined with its doctrines and community. From a young age, Jonathan found himself questioning the church\u2019s claim to hold the complete biblical truth, a skepticism that grew as he matured. His story takes a poignant turn with his parents\u0027 divorce, an event that, as a church leader\u0027s child, brought him embarrassment and a sense of needing to hide the truth. College years brought a significant personal revelation as Jonathan first identified as bisexual, only to temporarily retreat into the closet, under the pressure of his religious upbringing. Eventually, Jonathan fully embraced his identity as a gay man, a decision that led to a gradual but definitive distancing from the Adventist church, catalyzed by the conflicting narratives of being gay and Christian. This transition wasn\u0027t without its challenges; Jonathan lost many relationships from his church community but maintained a close, albeit complex, bond with his mother. Her gradual acceptance, though not complete affirmation, of his sexuality highlights a journey marked by struggles with perfectionism, sexual repression, and a deep-seated need for external validation - all legacies of his religious upbringing. This episode poignantly captures Jonathan\u0027s struggle to reconcile his faith and sexuality, navigating external judgments and internal conflicts, while nurturing the enduring love between him and his mother.\n\nFull Podcast Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqxJSRkMxgw \n\nMoral Combat is a podcast hosted by siblings Nathan and Zach Blaustone.

      "description": "In the emotionally charged Episode 57 of The Moral Combat Podcast, brothers Nathan and Zachary delve into the intricate and deeply personal topic of guilt, an enduring legacy of their religious trauma rooted in their evangelical Christian upbringing. This poignant discussion unravels the ways in which the church ingeniously employed guilt as a tool to wield control over their behaviors and thoughts. The narrative unfolds as they recount their struggles with a pervasive sense of inherent sinfulness and unworthiness, perpetuated by the church\u0027s unwavering emphasis on morality and repentance, a toxic blend that bred guilt like wildfire. Doubt and questioning, once taboo within the church\u0027s confines, evolved into sources of profound guilt, further stifling their quest for personal truth. The hosts candidly share the debilitating guilt that shrouded their exploration of sexuality and purity, particularly surrounding the deeply intimate issue of masturbation. Adding to this complex tapestry of trauma, their roles as pastor\u0027s kids thrust them into the unforgiving spotlight of the church\u0027s expectations for evangelism and outreach, a burden that only amplified their guilt. This lingering guilt, an enduring shadow of their religious past, seeped into their post-evangelical lives, casting a long shadow over their relationships and mental well-being. Yet, in the cocoon of their podcast, Nathan and Zachary unearth the power of vulnerability and open conversation, forging a path toward healing and ultimately finding solace in the embrace of gratitude. This episode delves into the intricate web of guilt woven by the evangelical church during their childhood, its far-reaching ramifications, and the resilience borne from these candid dialogues as the brothers journey toward healing.

      "description": "In the thought-provoking 56th episode of The Moral Combat Podcast, brothers Nathan and Zach embark on a profound exploration of the trauma inflicted by religious rituals within the evangelical Christian framework. Drawing upon their shared upbringing in a devout Christian household, the hosts engage in a candid conversation that spans a wide spectrum of rituals inherent to their religious past. They traverse the emotional terrain of their experiences, from the uplifting and spiritual nature of rituals such as worship through music and prayer, to the unsettling and, at times, manipulative aspects found in rituals like communion and altar calls. This introspective journey takes a poignant turn as they reflect upon the evolution of their relationship with these rituals since departing from evangelical Christianity. In this newfound perspective, prayer transitions from a coerced conversation with a divine entity to a personal and introspective dialogue.

Moral Combat, hosted by siblings Nathan and Zach Blaustone, is a heartfelt exploration of life\u0027s complexities, with a primary focus on healing from religious trauma. Step into their world as they navigate the realms of music production, confront the lingering echoes of religious trauma, and embrace laughter as a universal healer.
