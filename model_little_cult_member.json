      "description": "Join in a fascinating and eye-opening conversation with Dr. Susanna Kislenko. As a social psychologist, Susanna studies leadership in the entrepreneurial context. More specifically, Susanna\u2019s research focus is founder leadership past the founding (start-up) stage. Using qualitative research methods, Susanna\u2019s work pulls back the curtain on the challenges and potentially darker organizational consequences of long-term founder leadership, including Founder\u2019s Syndrome. Find Susana at https://www.susannakislenko.com/ and on IG @susannakislenko Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",
