From its beginnings as a pyramid scheme to the disturbing practices of DOS, we dissect the cult\u2019s charismatic leader Keith Raniere, his bizarre claims of genius, and the women who helped enforce his sinister vision. Dive deep into the allegations, the high-profile members involved, and the criminal convictions that rocked the world. Join us as we rate this chilling true crime story on our wickedness scale.

Hosted by Madison K. Drayton and JT, we take an in-depth look at the darkest corners of humanity, investigating criminals and cults before placing them on our custom wickedness scale. Each episode is a deep dive into motive, brutality, and more, scored live by our devoted fanbase, the Parajunkies, via interactive YouTube polls. No crime is too taboo, and no perpetrator escapes judgment in our pursuit of dissecting wickedness.\nIn today\u2019s episode, we unravel the twisted history of the Twelve Tribes cult, a sinister Christian fundamentalist group cloaked in hippie charm and communal living. Beneath their seemingly idyllic fa\u00E7ade lies a disturbing doctrine that justifies racism, homophobia, and extreme child abuse. Led by founder Gene Spriggs, the Twelve Tribes controlled every aspect of their members\u2019 lives while spreading their oppressive beliefs across continents. We examine the horrifying tales of ex-members, accounts of systemic abuse, and the lasting scars left by one of the most troubling cults in modern history. Buckle up as we rate the Twelve Tribes from One to Wicked \u2014 spoiler alert, they\u2019re pretty wicked.\n\nInside the Twelve Tribes\nhttps://youtu.be/CSnMHQInc1w?si=g_wqtDtWwbfAib4u\nThe Yellow Deli Doc\nhttps://youtu.be/pWbXkkywGWE?si=H_zzlSojygAKqBHC\nWhat drove religious elders to leave a controversial cult?\nhttps://youtu.be/918Su4VgiY4?si=yoH-GekxQMb3XU_D\n Grateful Dead Show hartford 4-26-09\nhttps://youtu.be/m4AKlJlqyMU?si=C0Xvf53Mo1L6tQqE\nThe Common Farm\nhttps://youtu.be/zSsyDjIQV9w?si=OMj11mEie9ACjmCF\n12 Tribes Savannah, Ga\nhttps://youtu.be/i19yM5GJse8?si=Q6-TM8EhWPR9Tp3c\nI spent 7 years in a cult\nhttps://youtu.be/_85cT-4W2Bg?si=Gdhn_piAIQ0bFgcX\nI team: Former member of Twelve Tribes Religgious Group Alleges..\nhttps://youtu.be/wKF2Cmngxfs?si=ymwWkjbnOgBi_Fw1",
