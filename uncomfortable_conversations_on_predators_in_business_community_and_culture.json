      "description": "Jennifer Rajala spent 8 years and recruited hundreds of people into Arbonne, a skin care \u0026 wellness company in the Multi-Level Marketing Industry, eventually morphing into an MLM coach and self-development junkie. Starting with learning to recruit others into MLM, all while having a newborn baby, her part time \u201Csuccess\u201D got her moving up the ranks eventually quitting her job as a social worker, to build \u201Cher business\u201D full time. In 2019 she was recruited into Rankmakers, a MLM Coaching Program run by Ray Higdon. She quickly became a top coach and a go-to coach within the Rankmaker System investing 3 years with promises of becoming a Top Speaker and Leadership Coach in the industry. Meanwhile, she was hustling to grow RankMakers system without any hourly wage, no benefits, no personal balance. This continued through the pandemic with sales tactics to target \u201Cat-home opportunities\u201D. Disgruntled with the process, she was told it was her mindset, so began taking more personal development courses with Tony Robbins, \u201Cto become a better coach\u201D. In 2021, after working on herself for so many years, she was burned out and noticed a friend on TikTok who had left and was speaking out against the MLM industry and Coaching business model. She woke up and in May 2022 she confronted Ray in one of the leadership meetings and then left the meeting. Within 24 hours I was ex-communicated. Today she is a fierce voice speaking out as an anti-MLM advocate. She lives in Michigan with her husband Derek and their 3 daughters for the last 10 years.
