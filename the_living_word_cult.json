      "description": "In our final episode of the season we dive into a treasure trove of archived materials from the 1970s that expose the secrets of The Living Word Fellowship\u2019s bizarre doomsday preparations. These guidelines were delivered on leaflets that we recently received from a former follower of John Robert Stevens\u2019 cult. We share more revealing letters from listeners, including another former tape editor with tea from the tape room. We also hear from a couple of Kalona, Iowa locals who experienced the cultiness of the Shiloh compound first-hand.   Scott Barker and Charity Navalesi are former members, born and raised in The Living Word Fellowship. They are investigating this organization, founded by John Robert Stevens in 1951, that branded itself as a Christian church for over seventy years but turned out to be just another cult. Stevens demanded full submission of his followers until his death in 1983 and when his successors, Gary \u0026 Marilyn Hargrave took over, the beliefs and practices became even more extreme as they levied control over the congregants for the next three decades.   In 2018 a former member finally spoke up after Marilyn\u0027s death accusing her son of abuse. There are five active lawsuits. The organization is a shadow of what it once was, but some remain believers of John Robert Stevens\u0027 teachings and many maintain loyalty to Gary Hargrave. Gary has a new following on social media and an active \u0022ministry\u0022.  ----- If you or someone you know has a mental illness, is struggling emotionally, or has concerns about their mental health, there are ways to get help.

She spent most nights of her childhood in the church\u2019s recording studio which was run by accused serial abuser and leader Rick Holbrook. She talks about how her troubled home life caused her to seek out family in the form of the church despite its toxicity by immersing herself in the never-ending work. She discusses her abrupt and dramatic exit from the Fellowship and how she was immediately shunned for making one big decision without the church\u2019s permission.

      "description": "Larry Bobo joined The Living Word Fellowship in Des Moines, Iowa in 1969. From there he watched as leadership was expelled for not fully submitting to John Robert Stevens\u2019 teachings. As a teenager he experienced sexual abuse at the hands of a leader and a another member of the church. In later years he became a leader himself and was relocated to the Colorado church where he called out inconsistencies in the Living Word doctrine to Marilyn and Gary Hargrave and the head leadership of the Fellowship in a detailed letter. Afterwords he was immediately silenced, literally being told he was not allowed to speak in the church. Eventually he left the Fellowship and discovered his own path back into Christianity. We talk with Larry about personal relationships with God, abuse in Christian churches and what being a Christian means to him.

In early adulthood, she moved to the Church of The Living Word in Los Angeles, where the abuse only escalated. Not only was Lauren regularly abused by Rick Holbrook, but she shares with us a traumatic sexual assault perpetrated by a member of the Fellowship, which was covered up by church leadership, including Marilyn and Gary Hargrave. Through all of the abuses she endured, Lauren was instructed not to tell her mother, report abuses to authorities, or seek professional help. She tells us about the lasting effects these experiences have on her and how she continues to work toward healing. ______________________________________  Scott and Charity are former members, born and raised in The Living Word Fellowship.

      "description": "What is the truth about John Robert Stevens? Throughout the history of The Living Word Fellowship cult rumors circulated about John\u0027s purported infidelities and indiscretions, but these rumors were always excused away by the belief that his \u0022apostleship\u0022 outweighed the importance of any questionable behavior. His claims of time travel and having the power to cause the deaths of people he deemed nephilim such as John Lennon and the John F. Kennedy were among the many unbelievable things that his followers bought into. These excuses were perpetuated by his successor, Gary Hargrave. In this episode we delve into these topics and reveal our findings on one of the most recent and biggest allegations against JRS: that he plagiarized his manifesto \u0022To Be A Christian\u0022, which was the legacy of his ministry.

Beau never attended the church itself, but was a student at the Living Word based school, Centers of Learning, in North Hills, California, which was originally attended only by members of TLWF and later opened up to the public. His unique observations as a non-member give us a window into how bizarre the church and its practices came across to the outside world.

Born and raised in The Living Word Fellowship,\u00A0hosts Scott Barker and Charity Navalesi discuss their experiences growing up in this modern day cult, conducting in-depth interviews with other former members and exploring the hidden truths of an organization that masqueraded as a non-denominational Christian church for over 70 years, at its peak growing to 100 chapters in 10 countries. In 2018, a former member came forward on social media with allegations of mental, emotional and sexual abuse within the church, spawning a movement of truth-telling that caused the almost immediate demise of the organization, its entire leadership resigning as more and more accusations of misconduct were revealed. In this podcast we\u0027ll discuss the history of the organization, its ultimate collapse, and the effects of its abusive culture and toxic leadership on former members. Adding a touch of humor, because if you can\u0027t laugh about it, it just sucks too intensely, Scott and Charity unpack their and others\u0027 experiences, how they\u0027re recovering from religious abuse and navigating life today, and the moment they realized, \u0022Oops!

A former member released letters showing that she had been sexually harassed and abused by the TLW leadership for years. Further, she showed that the church used their system of control to \u0022shame, blame and silence\u0022 her for almost 20 years. Only when Shalom Abrahamson spoke out was the leadership forced to respond. \nWhat followed was an unprecedented exodus of members from the church, many of whom reached out on social media to show their support to Shalom and additionally share their own stories of abuse from the church leaders. \nThis episode dives into the most telling moments from Shalom\u0027s letters, how and why she decided to post them, and the system of control the leaders of the church used to protect the abusers and silence their victims.\n\n\n\u00A9WalkDoc LLC\n\nDirector - Scott Barker\nEditor - Alex Ferris\nAdditional Editing - Scott Barker\nAssistant Editor - Shelby Stancliff\nEditorial/Graphics/VFX and so much more - Leah O\u0027Connor\nAudio Mix and Design - Dynamite Laser Beam\nCamera - Alex Ferris and Scott Barker \n\nPodcast Links:\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/oops-im-in-a-cult/id1703501829\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/2YlZeTiuons5y4J3RZYXSv\n\nContact:\neMail - contactwalkdoc@gmail.com\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/thecultdoc\nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@thewalkdoc\nMore - https://linktr.ee/thewalkdoc\n\nIf you or someone you know has a mental illness, is struggling emotionally, or has concerns about their mental health, there are ways to get help.

      "description": "It\u2019a a clear quiet Christmas Eve. You stand from your window and you spy the most wonderful thing! \n\nFor 35 years the residents of North Hollywood eagerly made camp on their front lawns awaiting the Magical Christmas Caroling Truck musical parade!  To some, this event, on the darkest night of the year, is \u201Cmore important than Christmas Day\u201D.  Families pour out of their home and sing along as The Truck passed by. Drinks in hand they follow the Christmas truck and its trail of dancing \u201Ccandy cane girls\u201D up and down the streets of the San Fernando Valley. After three decades, many residents can\u2019t imagine or remember a single Christmas without the presence of The Magical Christmas Caroling Truck. \n\nThis Holiday Parade recruited 150 volunteers including the dancers, the singers, the drivers, security, and of course Santa himself. Its sound system rivaled the Macy\u2019s Day parade floats and definitely beat out even the most outlandish of the neighbor\u2019s light displays. Bright and loud, the truck boasted that its creators and volunteers come from the Hollywood studios right down the street - Warner Brothers, Universal, and Disney.  \n\nHowever the truth, that was not advertised on the 11 o\u2019clock news, was that the volunteers and sponsors of the Holiday Christmas event were all from The Church of The Living Word in North Hills California. In the weeks leading up to the event they trained in a recording studio owned by The Living Word Church in an industrial section of North Hollywood just under the Burbank Airport flight path. The money that funded the Magical Christmas Truck came from donations to The Living Word Fellowship. And the creator and inventor of the Toluca Lake Holiday Truck was one of the head pastors of the The Living Word. \n\nThe separating line that was intentionally drawn between the truck and the church would keep many of the neighbors in the North Hollywood, Teluca Lake, Burbank neighborhoods from knowing the absolute chaos that was raining down on the this Pastor and creator of The Magical Christmas Caroling Truck. One October night in the hight of the #metoo era, a former member of the TLW church posted a damning letter that tarnished the reputation of Rick Holbrook (the creator of the truck) and the heads of the Living Word Church, Gary and Marilyn Hargrave. After reading the letters, members of the church began to post stories of their own further dragging these three Christian leaders down into the dirt. By the time Christmas came around members of the Living Word could not care less about the Magical Christmas Caroling Truck. \n\nThis is only the beginning of the story.\n\nCREDITS:\nEP 1 - Magical Christmas Caroling Cult\n\nDirected By Scott Barker\nCinematographer - Jackson Veigel\nAdditional Camera - Scott Barker - Alex Ferris\nEditing - Scott Barker - Alex Farris\nAssistant Editing - Leah O\u0027Connor - Shelby Stancliff\nAudio Mix - Dynamite Laser Beam\n\n\u00A9Walk Doc, LLC \n\nContact:\neMail - contactwalkdoc@gmail.com\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/thecultdoc\nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@thewalkdoc\nMore - https://linktr.ee/thewalkdoc\n\nIf you or someone you know has a mental illness, is struggling emotionally, or has concerns about their mental health, there are ways to get help.
