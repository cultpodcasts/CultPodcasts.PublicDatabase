      "description": "For thousands of years, human beings have sought spiritual connection and enlightenment. A lot of us are seekers by nature, we want to know why we\u2019re here and what\u2014if anything\u2014comes next. Sometimes it can seem like most of humankind is walking around with their heads in the sand, and we don\u2019t wanna be one of those people. We want to chase after the secrets. We want to be plugged in. There\u2019s a long tradition, as part of this search for truth, of self-deprivation as a spiritual virtue. Taking a vow of silence or poverty. Forbidding alcohol or dancing or sex. Fasting. Some people believe it strips away everything extra and leaves the spirit more open to connection with the infinite. Others prefer a more balanced approach to life, like the Buddhist Middle Way. But for those who choose to throw away worldly pleasures, the path can get pretty extreme. Today we\u2019ll tell you about a group who claim they\u2019ve given up one of our most basic needs\u2014food\u2014and have learned to live on nothing but light and air. Are these people just fully spiritually attuned, or are they just grifters?
