      "title": "Heart and Soul: Seeking justice from Opus Dei",
      "description": "Opus Dei is a controversial Catholic organisation with schools and conference centres across the globe. Close links to the Vatican mean members are highly influential within the Catholic church. Opus Dei is Latin for \u201CWork of God\u201D and their aim is to help people to achieve holiness through their everyday work. The vast majority of members are lay people. Within Opus Dei, \u201Cassistant numeraries\u201D are women responsible for cooking and cleaning in Opus Dei centres. They appear to have mainly been recruited from poor or working-class backgrounds and through hospitality schools affiliated with the organisation. Former assistant numeraries say they were overworked, unpaid, isolated from their families and emotionally and spiritually abused. Journalist Antonia Cundy speaks to women from Latin America who share their stories.",
