This i can agree with, he is in sin, by claiming to be a false Jesus, but also, in error, by teaching all these falsehoods. I wish for AJ, Mary, or any one who believes what he teaches, and believes that he is Jesus, to go and investigate the evidences for The Bible, for the historical Jesus, and the doctrinal stances of Christian thought by the likes of Cultish/Apologia Studios, Mike Winger, Inspiring Philosophy on YouTube, and even here on Spotify.

      "description": "Welcome back to the show, this is the episode where we look and comment on what AJ had to say about his, so called, First Century life as \u0022Jesus\u0022. Written back in the 2nd month of 2006, This is the most important, and most controversial claim that AJ makes about himself. We look at the claims he makes and look at what the bible has to say on this topic. We must always do this as Christians, and so should non-christians, even if you don\u0027t believe Jesus as lord, let the record of history speak loudly.
