      "description": "Is a convincing apology enough to earn early release? Could convicted child abusers Ruby Frankie and Jody Hildebrandt manipulate their way out of prison? On this episode of \u0022Hidden Killers\u0022, Tony Brueski and psychotherapist Shavaun Scott dissect the sentencing of Ruby Frankie and Jody Hildebrandt. Sentenced to four to sixty years for their horrific abuse, their ultimate fate rests in the hands of the parole board. Shavaun analyzes Ruby Frankie\u0027s courtroom statement, calling it a \u0022coached response\u0022 aimed at manipulating the system. Tony questions if parole boards are easily swayed by such performances, or if genuine remorse can be faked. The discussion then turns to Jody Hildebrandt\u0027s claim that she \u0022sincerely loved these children,\u0022 a statement Shavaun links to the narcissistic tendencies often found in cult leaders. With the possibility of release looming, the podcast delves into the chilling question of whether these women pose a continued threat to the public. Could they resurface under new identities, preying on the vulnerable once again? Closing Question: How do we protect ourselves and our communities from those who mask their monstrous behavior behind a facade of love and concern? Want to listen to ALL of our podcasts AD-FREE?
