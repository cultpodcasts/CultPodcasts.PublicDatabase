      "description": "This week we dive into the Not so SHINY and certainly not HAPPY world of the Institute of Basic Life Principle\u0027s aka IBLP organization. An organization that was featured in the Amazon Prime documentary \u0022Shiny Happy People: Duggar Family Secrets\u0022. We learn about the smooth talking leader, Bill Gothard and the truly heartbreaking things he was teaching people. We learn the terrible things he was doing to \u0022Gothard Girl\u0027s\u0022 and we unpack how the Duggar family, of TLC\u0027s 19 Kids and Counting fame, became the token family of this organization. Lindsey also walks us through growing up being homeschooled using the teachings of IBLP, something they called ATI (Advance Training Institute) where she introduces us to \u0022Wisdom Books\u0022 that provided little real wisdom and were certainly not advanced. So, whether you watched the documentary and want more insider information or are learning about this all for the first time I urge you to listen._____________________________________Lindsey\u0027s \u0022Crazy Pretty\u0022 Website: https://crazypretty.com/Cult Chronicles IG: https://www.instagram.com/thecultchronicles/Lindsey\u0027s LinkTree: https://linktr.ee/Cultchronicles_____________________________________Link to all things Not in a Huff Podcast: https://linktr.ee/notinahuffpodcastPlease follow/subscribe to the podcast to be the first to see new episodes when they come out each week.
