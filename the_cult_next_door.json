      "description": "Part 1: In this gripping and deeply personal episode of The Cult Next Door, hosts Mattie and Ashleigh are joined by a very special guest: their sister, Jen. Together, they open up about their shared experiences growing up in the shadow of a family cult and the heart-wrenching and lifelong ordeal of a Christian doomsday cult led by their own father. Join us as we delve into the harrowing world of cults and the profound impact they had on Mattie, Ashleigh, and Jen\u0027s lives. They\u0027ll recount their early memories, the seductive promises of the cult, and the chilling reality they eventually faced.  This raw and emotional conversation sheds light on the hidden dangers of cults and the insidious role that narcissism can play in the rise of cult leaders. We explore the complex dynamics within their family and the challenges they encountered along the way.  Let\u2019s get social!: https://linktr.ee/cultnextdoorpodcast  We\u2019d love to hear from you.
