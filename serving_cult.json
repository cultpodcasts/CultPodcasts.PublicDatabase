      "description": "Today is a solo episode, in Part 1 I discuss why I love studying cults, and in Part 2 I answer two listener questions. During the first half I explain how beneficial I find it to observe cults. I discuss how cults can be a mirror for our interpersonal relationships, and how empathizing with their victims helps us examine our own trauma responses. I also detail how engaging in cult material can help us be more aware and alert of cultish dynamics in the mundane and everyday. In Part 2, the first listener asks if their post-breakup expectations were unrealistic, and the second listener asks how to stay friends with people not doing inner work. In both scenarios I detail the ladder of trust as an appropriate tool to create intimacy and mutual investment. \u00A0 To submit a question, you can email it or send a voice recording of your question to be played on the podcast to hello@advancedbitches.com \u00A0 LINKS \u00A0 The Advanced Bitchifesto - https://www.advancedbitches.com/the-bitchifesto Advanced Bitches Bingo - https://www.advancedbitches.com/bingo-instructions Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving by Pete Walker https://amzn.to/3RLCkxm \u00A0 Keep up with me: https://www.instagram.com/advancedbitches/ https://www.advancedbitches.com/membership https://www.tiktok.com/@advancedbitches https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCND6RMWO-erRUYMXVOAynWQ \u00A0 My books: \u00A0 The Irreverent Grief Guide:\u00A0 How to F*cking Survive Months 1-3 https://amzn.to/3sZYalY The Irreverent Trust Guide:\u00A0 How to Trust Again after Past Trauma F*cked You Up \u00A0https://amzn.to/3JJbIKA \u00A0 Produced by Wowow",
