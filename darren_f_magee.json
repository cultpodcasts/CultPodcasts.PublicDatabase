      "description": "Mark Vicente is an award winning film maker and author. He is a former member, and one of the whistle blowers that exposed the criminal activities going on in the nexium cult. His story is chronicled in the HBO series, \u2018The Vow\u2019. He is host of the \u2018WTF is on my mind?\u2019 podcast and YouTube channel where he discusses, among other things, narcissism, coercive behaviours, dark personality and cult behaviours often seen in everyday life. I had the pleasure of talking to Mark about NXIVM, and his journey from member to whistle blower, the personality types behind cult movements and how they mirror the same dynamics and patterns found in romantic relationships, families and organisations dominated by narcissists.
