      "description": "For part 2 of our dive into Cognitive Dissonance, I chat with fellow anti-MLM content creator and activist, Jenni Wild. We recall examples of cognitive dissonance from our own time in MLM, and as a \u0022BONUS\u0022 (ie. random tangent) I decided to ask Jenni the questions I was asked last weekend on the Content Creators Panel at the 2nd Annual Multilevel Marketing Conference! More about the conference can be found at https://www.MLMconference.com/\n\n***\n\nBITE Out Of MLM is a series that dives into some of the psychology terms, cult and manipulation tactics, and hot-button issues frequently heard in the anti-cult, anti-scam, anti-MLM world, and attempts to define them individually in formats that are accessible and digestible for the typical viewer of this kind of content. Topics may include terms used to describe the feelings one experiences when acting under undue influence and when leaving high-demand groups, as well as terms used to describe the manipulation tactics used by such groups.\n\nFor more resources please check out the following websites:\nhttps://www.freedomofmind.com/\nhttps://www.MLMchange.org/\nhttps://www.igotout.org/ \nhttps://www.foolproofme.org/ \nhttps://www.ponzinomics.com/ \n\nThe goal is accessibility, so I welcome any and all feedback and suggestions.
