      "description": "The Mormon church has always claimed to be accepting of everyone including the LGBTQ\u002B community. However, their actions and words spoken to the congregations paint a very different picture. You can be gay, but in order to receive all the blessings from God, you must remain celibate. It has come to our attention that in some wards (congregations), openly married gay couples have not only been able to keep their membership (rather than be excommunicated), but are allowed to take the sacrament and even hold important positions in the church. \r\n\r\nJoined by Dillan, who was recently featured on Jubilee\u2019s Middleground \u201CMormons vs Ex-Mormons\u201D, and @nuancehoe , we discuss these monumental changes in the right direction. \r\n\r\nAfter the live, you will be automatically redirected to another live stream on Carah\u2019s channel to hear more of Dillan\u2019s story:  https://www.youtube.com/live/tRYIIyI7fIE?si=OeCtP8XmRJltoPtJ\n\r\n\n\nFind Dillan\u0027s recent appearance on Jubliee\u0027s \u0022Can Mormons and Ex Mormons See Eye to Eye? | Middle Ground\u0022 video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Run1f29po8g\u0026rco=1\n\nCheck out Nuancehoe\u0027s reaction to Jublilee\u0027s video:\nMormons BOMB In Cringeworthy Debate | ExMo Jubilee Reaction\nhttps://youtu.be/ubja03yeDQc?si=ZKmpgt31yuxxSfz3\n\nCheck out Mormon Stories\u0027 reaction to Jubliee\u0027s video:\n\u0022Jubilee\u0027s \u201CMormons vs Ex-Mormons\u201D on Middle Ground - Ex-Mormon Cast Reacts | Ep. 186\u0022\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohJ4RSQJBzU\n\r\nMormon Stories Episode further expanding on the topic: \r\nMarried Gay Mormons Get Sacrament and Callings\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/DN4zFTCQL5w?si=CojKiUe_RdBWqsuB\r\n\r\nFind Nuancehoe \r\nYT @nuancehoe\r\nIG https://www.instagram.com/nuancehoe/\n\nOur C2C vacation where we can meet you in real life and go on adventures together has 6 spots left!

After 3.5 years and $250k spent with Grant \u0026 his organization, I realized that I had ignored all the signs in that environment that encouraged me to idolize Grant as a God, seek him for success, disconnect with those who don\u2019t align with him or me, chase money, deceive, \u0026 manipulate others to get what I want. \n\nI later found that Grant is being operated by the church of Scientology and after looking into that myself, it made sense why he treats people badly \u0026 why he teaches entrepreneurs to unethically scale their business.\n\nI have been publicly speaking about this consistently so that people can be aware of not only Grant, but ALL self serving entrepreneurs who prey on people\u2019s fears to manipulate them \u0026 teach them how to deceive others.

Things got even more out of control when he was put in prison for his crimes and a hit list he created was beginning to be carried out by some of his younger followers. Thankfully, the practice of blood atonement, by way of the LeBarons has been disavowed today, but the effects of these tragic teachings still linger in the lives of those who were affected by it.

The women who are often assigned and married off at a young age, are forced to bear as many children as possible. Warren took it upon himself to separate mothers and fathers from their children at astonishing rates. We will discuss with Ceci Hendrickson (a former polygamist wife and mother) all of the ways they suffered in the FLDS. \r\n\r\nWatch her full episode here: \r\nhttps://youtu.be/rHwJhPrXpYg\r\n\r\nFind Ceci on Social!\r\nIG: @Ceci.Hendrickson\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/ceci.hendrickson/\r\nClothing Line: https://pinkvalor.com/\r\nIG @pinkvalor\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/pinkvalor/\r\n\r\nOur C2C vacation where we can meet you in real life and go on adventures together has 7 spots left!

      "description": "Born and raised in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, Katie\u0027s home life was less than perfect.  However, her parents remained very loyal to the teachings and the gospel of the LDS Church.  After years of SA from an older brother, Katie\u0027s sister reported it to the Bishop during a confession.  The Bishop advised to keep it a secret from everyone, including her parents, as the shame the perpetrator would have faced being forced to come home early from his LDS mission would have been, in his opinion, too great.  Due to this negligence more CSA circulated through their immediate family amongst the siblings, including Katie.  \n\nThe fundraiser for \u0022Darkness to Light\u0022 is currently being approved by YouTube.

Using books like \u201CTo Train Up A Child\u201D, it was normal for fathers to break the will of their children as early as 18 months old.
