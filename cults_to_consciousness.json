      "description": "Misty Griffin returns to the studio to further discuss her experience growing up at the hands of her tort*ous mother and step father, who isolated her and her sister on a mountainside, then forced her into an Amish settlement at 18 years old.  Unfortunately, claiming religious exemption means a parent can fly under the radar ab*sing their chiIdren.  Misty now fights back, on a mission to help chiIdren in similar situations, stuck in ab*sive environments, that have no voice.  Misty has created a petition called \u0022Child Rights Act\u0022 that she hopes will one day become a bill, asking congress to step up and protect these voiceless chiIdren locked in cults. Currently at 33,000\u002B signatures, she hopes that with your help, in signing, and sharing this video / petition, she can gather enough signatures to get the attention of congress and get this bill passed.     \n\nSign petition here:  Http://www.Change.org/childrightsact \n\nTW: SA, CA,CSA, mentions of R*pe\n\nWatch her original interview:  https://youtu.be/wNzELfWNiUA\n\nFind and Support Misty!\nBuy her book \u0022Tears of the Silenced\u0022: https://amzn.to/49c2Qst\nIG @mistyelainegriffin\nhttps://www.instagram.com/mistyelainegriffin?igsh=NzBmMjdhZWRiYQ==\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100067656562700\u0026mibextid=LQQJ4d\nWebsite: https://www.mistygriffin.com\n\nSupport C2C - Any donations are welcome and appreciated to support the making of this podcast.\n\nFind our FULL (uncensored) merch store here!\nhttps://cults-to-consciousness-shop.fourthwall.com/en-usd\n\nPatreon\nhttps://www.patreon.com/cultstoconsciousness\n\nVenmo @sheliseann\n\n**FULLY BOOKED** Our C2C vacation where we can meet you in real life and go on adventures together has sold out!

Having spent his childhood homeschooled by his mother, at 12, his parents decided to incorporate Bill Gothard\u2019s practices into his education.  As a form of pun*shment for having a girlfriend, at 16, Davey was sent to an intense IBLP training center.  Instead of correcting his \u201Cbad\u201D behavior, Davey further rebelled, which ultimately led him to spend 7 days in the Prayer Room, the center\u2019s solitary confinement, which only had a bible.  Davey recounts his losing-touch-with-reality experience, his attempts at escape, and now, all of these years later, going back to the center where the source of his decades of living with trauma began.

Even from prison, the entire church population was conditioned to believe he was innocent and persecuted by the government. However, as the years went on, Ada explains how his prophesies and commandments would get more and more odd and demanding. He would continue splitting up families, send people all over different states, disfellowship, then re-baptize and for some, completely cut them off. Ada was sent away for what was supposed to be 10 months. Five years later, she realized even if he allowed her back home, she wouldn\u2019t go.

      "description": "TW:  DV, SA, R*pe\n\nTia Levings discusses her dark reality in Christian fundamentalism, with evangelical patriarchy and religious trauma.  Having appeared in the Amazon docu-series,\u00A0Shiny Happy People, and written a harrowing memoir, A Well-Trained Wife\u00A0she reveals how she had to save herself and her family and details the ways that extreme views can manifest in a marriage.\n\nRecruited into the fundamentalist Quiverfull movement as a young wife, Tia Levings learned that being a good Christian meant following a list of additional life principles\u2013\u2013a series of secret, special rules to obey. Being a godly and submissive wife in Christian Patriarchy included strict discipline, isolation, and an alternative lifestyle that appeared wholesome to outsiders. Women were to be silent, \u201Ckeepers of the home.\u201D\n\nTia knew that to their neighbors her family was strange, but she also couldn\u0027t risk exposing their secret lifestyle to police, doctors, teachers, or anyone outside of their church. Christians were called in scripture to be \u201Cin the world, not of it.\u201D So, she hid in plain sight as years of abuse and pain followed. When Tia realized she was the only one who could protect her children from becoming the next generation of patriarchal men and submissive women, she began to resist and question how they lived. But in the patriarchy, a woman with opinions is in danger, and eventually, Tia faced an urgent and extreme choice: stay and face dire consequences, or flee with her children.\n\nPre order Tia\u2019s book: A Well-Trained Wife\nwww.tialevings.com\n\nFind Tia on social media!\nIG:  @tialevingswriter\nwww.instagram.com/tialevingswriter\n\nhttps://substack.com/@tialevings\nThe Anti-Fundamentalist\n\nOur C2C vacation where we can meet you in real life and go on adventures together has 3 spots left!

She was told he would even make the biggest decision of her life for her\u2014 who she was going to marry. She was gr**med to be a submissive wife under the patriarchy movement and stay-at-home daughters movement. Her homeschooling was completely unregulated and not much attention was paid to her education, because her sole purpose was to be a mother who eventually belonged to her husband. Terrified that anything less than strict obedience would land her in the fiery depths of Hell, she felt she had no choice but to go along with it well into her 20s.

      "description": "The Mormon church has always claimed to be accepting of everyone including the LGBTQ\u002B community. However, their actions and words spoken to the congregations paint a very different picture. You can be gay, but in order to receive all the blessings from God, you must remain celibate. It has come to our attention that in some wards (congregations), openly married gay couples have not only been able to keep their membership (rather than be excommunicated), but are allowed to take the sacrament and even hold important positions in the church. \r\n\r\nJoined by Dillan, who was recently featured on Jubilee\u2019s Middleground \u201CMormons vs Ex-Mormons\u201D, and @nuancehoe , we discuss these monumental changes in the right direction. \r\n\r\nAfter the live, you will be automatically redirected to another live stream on Carah\u2019s channel to hear more of Dillan\u2019s story:  https://www.youtube.com/live/tRYIIyI7fIE?si=OeCtP8XmRJltoPtJ\n\r\n\n\nFind Dillan\u0027s recent appearance on Jubliee\u0027s \u0022Can Mormons and Ex Mormons See Eye to Eye? | Middle Ground\u0022 video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Run1f29po8g\u0026rco=1\n\nCheck out Nuancehoe\u0027s reaction to Jublilee\u0027s video:\nMormons BOMB In Cringeworthy Debate | ExMo Jubilee Reaction\nhttps://youtu.be/ubja03yeDQc?si=ZKmpgt31yuxxSfz3\n\nCheck out Mormon Stories\u0027 reaction to Jubliee\u0027s video:\n\u0022Jubilee\u0027s \u201CMormons vs Ex-Mormons\u201D on Middle Ground - Ex-Mormon Cast Reacts | Ep. 186\u0022\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohJ4RSQJBzU\n\r\nMormon Stories Episode further expanding on the topic: \r\nMarried Gay Mormons Get Sacrament and Callings\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/DN4zFTCQL5w?si=CojKiUe_RdBWqsuB\r\n\r\nFind Nuancehoe \r\nYT @nuancehoe\r\nIG https://www.instagram.com/nuancehoe/\n\nOur C2C vacation where we can meet you in real life and go on adventures together has 6 spots left!

      "description": "Ben John: \u0022As a beginner entrepreneur/business owner in 2019, I was introduced to a book by Grant Cardone(The 10X Rule) that lured me into mentorship from him. After 3.5 years and $250k spent with Grant \u0026 his organization, I realized that I had ignored all the signs in that environment that encouraged me to idolize Grant as a God, seek him for success, disconnect with those who don\u2019t align with him or me, chase money, deceive, \u0026 manipulate others to get what I want. I later found that Grant is being operated by the church of Scientology and after looking into that myself, it made sense why he treats people badly \u0026 why he teaches entrepreneurs to unethically scale their business. I have been publicly speaking about this consistently so that people can be aware of not only Grant, but ALL self serving entrepreneurs who prey on people\u2019s fears to manipulate them \u0026 teach them how to deceive others. I\u2019ve done it regularly on my instagram/FB page, Instagram lives, \u0026 interviews.\u0022 Links to Ben\u2019s book, \u201CMisguided Mentor\u201D and businesses on his instagram page IG: @benjaminjohnmic FB: Ben\u2019s Massive Impact Our C2C vacation where we can meet you in real life and go on adventures together has 5 spots left!

Thankfully, the practice of blood atonement, by way of the LeBarons has been disavowed today, but the effects of these tragic teachings still linger in the lives of those who were affected by it.

However, her parents remained very loyal to the teachings and the gospel of the LDS Church.  After years of SA from an older brother, Katie\u0027s sister reported it to the Bishop during a confession.  The Bishop advised to keep it a secret from everyone, including her parents, as the shame the perpetrator would have faced being forced to come home early from his LDS mission would have been, in his opinion, too great.  Due to this negligence more CSA circulated through their immediate family amongst the siblings, including Katie.  \n\nThe fundraiser for \u0022Darkness to Light\u0022 is currently being approved by YouTube.

However, when a church controls their members using fear and manipulation, even when someone didn\u0027t do anything wrong, such as a survivor of SA, it creates extreme issues of safety for that person. Today we speak with Kris Hillberg who was given a disciplinary council and disfellowshipped from the LDS faith for a brutal attack when she was only 18 years old. There is so much to discuss when it comes to feeling safe to report, when there is truly no support system for what the LDS church would consider \u0022sins\u0022.\r\n\r\nWatch the full deep dive episode with Kris here: https://youtu.be/hJa6Je3_1A0\r\nFind Kris on IG @kristjana_hillberg https://www.instagram.com/kristjana_hillberg\r\nCheck out her Podcast called \u0022I F*cking Knew\u0022 https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/krishillberg\r\n\r\nIt\u0027s official!

First in an Old Order Amish settlement, then a black bumper Mennonite Settlement, the ab*se was condoned and accepted by the community. Using books like \u201CTo Train Up A Child\u201D, it was normal for fathers to break the will of their children as early as 18 months old. Against her wishes, she was forced into an arranged marriage which had many of the same characteristics of her family life.
