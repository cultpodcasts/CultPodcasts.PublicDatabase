Our discussion includes:\n\nAnalyzing IHOP\u0027s teachings and culture\nThe debate over whether IHOP can be considered a cult\nThe importance of critical thinking in faith communities\nBalancing accountability with compassion in addressing church scandals\nThe lack of shepherding after the atombomb was lobbed at Mike and why they\u0027ve waited so long to try after so many have left the faith \n\nWhether you\u0027re a former IHOP member, a current church leader, or someone interested in religious studies, this episode offers valuable insights into one of the most significant scandals in recent Christian history.\nLike, subscribe, and share your thoughts in the comments.
