      "description": "Internalized misogyny is when women and girls believe and act on sexist stereotypes and myths about themselves and other women. It can manifest in many ways, including: \nJudging women\u0027s sexual behavior differently from men\u0027s \nBelieving women are too emotional to be leaders \nThinking negatively about feminine things \nFeeling hatred for other women \nShaming, doubting, or undervaluing oneself or other women \nDeeming womanhood a competition rather than collaboration \nInternalized misogyny can be rooted in patriarchal oppression, stereotypes, and pressure to identify with a specific label. It can also be deeply ingrained from girlhood and passed down through generations. \nThere is no \u0022right\u0022 way to unlearn internalized misogyny, but the first step is recognizing that it exists and accepting it. Speaking up and holding others accountable for their internalized misogyny can help lead to a better understanding of the issue. #jesus #duet #megachurch #spirituality #storytime #church #preaching #SPIRITUALABUSE #CULTS #indoctrination #mentalhealth #selflove #selfcare #selfimprovement #selfhelp #selfdiscovery #selfmotivation #womenempowerment #women #women_respect_video #women_issues #awakening #consciousness #subconsciousmind #carljung #psychology",
