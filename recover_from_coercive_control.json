      "description": "This is part 1 of a series of clips in which I unpack the nuances of defining a cult? My starting point is considering cults with a little \u0022c\u0022 and cults with a big \u0022C\u0022.\n\nThroughout my explanations I use the story of Little Red Riding Hood as an analogy. \n\nUnderstanding Trauma: The Difference Between \u0022Big T\u0022 and \u0022Little t\u0022 Trauma: https://www.recoverfromcoercivecontrol.com/post/understanding-trauma-the-difference-between-big-t-and-little-t-trauma\n\nRick Ross: https://culteducation.com/\nSteven Hassan: https://freedomofmind.com/\nJanja Lalich: https://janjalalich.com/\n\nMusic by Greeble\nInstagram: @Greeble_.",

      "description": "In late 2017 my daughter joined what I now understand to be a destructive cult. Gradually, over the next few years I was estranged from her through coercive control tactics applied by the leadership. I am sharing my story in the hope that I can help prevent others from going through the horrendous ordeal.  \n\nwww.recoverfromcoercivecontrol.com\n\nMy story was shared  in a documentary by 7NEWS Spotlight. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_D64VS-Owc\n\nMusic by Greeble \nIntagram: Greeble_",
