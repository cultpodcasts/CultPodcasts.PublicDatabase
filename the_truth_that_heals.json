The fraud. The manipulation. The fear. And so for today\u0027s episode I want to talk about trafficking that I believe I experienced. Many will say that I wasn\u0027t trafficked and that I chose that life. The truth is many of us couldn\u0027t leave. The superiors of the group held onto our passports and other important documents to make sure that we wouldn\u0027t leave and some ex members even had their visas ripped out of their passports to keep them from leaving. Some will say that I wasn\u0027t being trafficked. I say I was trafficked. What do you say?  ---   Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/ryan-anthony-hernandez/support",

      "description": "Once you are in an End Times Cult it\u0027s as if you have been frozen in time. All you look forward to are persecutions and THE END. After being inside for so long I finally found my freedom however I soon discovered that I still felt trapped. I felt like a prisoner and a part of me wanted to go back to the cult. I didn\u0027t have any life skills. I didn\u0027t have any idea of what the real world was like. I was trained, or programmed, to look at education and relationships as something toxic. It took quite a while for me to untangle my thoughts from the lies and to finally break free and find peace with life in the outside world. While I thought I was preparing for the end I now look back and think how controlling the community leaders were to the point that we had to see abuse as a gift from God, or as a reflection of God\u0027s infinite love.I want to share my story as well as the dirty side of my story such as the depression, the loneliness, the heartaches, so that the viewer may understand what life is like for someone who has left an end times cult. Not everyone went through what I experienced however I am sure that there are many who left not knowing what to do with their life. Feeling like you were hated by God, hated by the community, and that your life was damned. If the cult leaders are in charge of the narrative you will only see doom and gloom. It is my hope that survivors of cult abuse, of abuse within a Catholic Community that pretends to follow Christ while beating the members, it is my hope that survivors take back the narrative and live their life with peace. These cult leaders even wounded my religious faith nonetheless I have been on a path towards healing, forgiveness, love, and courage.To support my journey and my channel check out my links:Linktree: https://linktr.ee/truththathealspodPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/Truththathealspodcast/posts  ---   Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/ryan-anthony-hernandez/support",

      "description": "Purity Culture has been coming up a lot lately in my quest to understand life, religion, trauma, and healing. To get a better understanding of what this culture was like I sat down and discussed this theme with Erin so that my understanding of it would be clearer. We talked about some of the good things regarding purity, but, we also talked about the things that many don\u0027t want to be talked about, or, the dark side of purity culture. While many may think that Purity Culture only focuses on staying virgin one will begin to see that there is a lot of judgement and shaming in this environment. Also, in many instances, the youth are being formed to look upon the body as something dirty. Many who are brought up in the system of purity have neglected other Christian virtues such as patience and kindness. Also, there seems to be a strong rush to condemn and beat down on those who don\u0027t reach the standards of purity which opens the door for shame and at times even trauma depending on the scenario.

      "description": "One of the hardest things for me to do is to breakdown the story of my cult experience in a way that is not complicated or all over the place. My journey inside the cult has been difficult at times to talk about, even to this day, but for me to tell my story I believe that it is best to simplify things to make the cult experience understandable for those who were not members. In no way is this episode an attempt to bash those who seek to live a life of purity and who cherish the chaste life. Not at all. Instead I simply wish to shed light on how the cult and leaders used purity as a way to bring guilt, control, and even fear upon members. It was even used as a tactic to recruit members by telling young adults that if they didn\u0027t \u0022try God first they would regret it.\u0022 Hopefully by listening to this episode people, including former cult members, will understand that there was a lot of abuse of power as well as terrible spiritual direction on the part of some of the superiors within the group. It is my desire by sharing my story that people will understand what we went through and that if there are people who feel guilt or shame from the experience may find freedom from the psychological, and at times physical, torture we endured.

Furthermore, Radiant Style breaks it down for us about how \u0022Purity Culture\u0022 was used to shame and control members, especially the women. While purity was hammered down upon the women and so much focus was given to modesty she noticed that there was a lack of attention on other important issues like morality, consent, boundaries, and the understanding of what it means to be a good person.

He is a religious trauma survivor homeschooled K-12 and raised in a fundamentalist Christian cult (Independent Fundamental Baptist movement). He brings awareness to spiritual and religious abuse. Being a part of the LGBTQ\u002B community and experiencing religious trauma has inspired him to pursue psychology to help survivors. After being homeschooled, he found his way to Bob Jones University. He attended the fundamentalist Christian college for over three years until he was expelled in his last semester for sharing his story and denouncing fundamentalist teachings. He has a limited podcast premiering soon called \u0022Surviving Bob Jones University: A Christian Cult.\u0022 This podcast explores the school\u0027s history, the psychology of fundamentalism, the criteria for cults, and survivors\u0027 experiences.

Bing to keep members silent about abuses in the community.                                      I was put on silence and expected to be in prayer like a robot. Dead to emotions and dead to myself. I was expected to \u201Crejoice\u201D when I received obedience that gave me suffering because that was how a \u201Cvictim soul\u201D is supposed to behave. But this theology gave a pass to superiors to be abusive and even harsh because as victim souls members were trained to rejoice because the more pain we received we had to see it as a gift from God.

A lot of it had to do with abuse so Discretion is advised as some of the conversations in this episode may make many people uncomfortable.

It hasn\u0027t been easy but I am glad that I found the courage to do this. Secondly, I wanted to talk about suffering. There are so many discussions that can be recorded on suffering and I wanted to focus on the way the cult sees suffering: they pretty much glorified it... versus the suffering that people endure while trying to be virtuous. It\u0027s hard to really explain but I am just sharing my thoughts on the cults way of viewing suffering and how they pushed this narrative that suffering was good in order to allow abuse to happen.

She\u0027s an actor, writer, filmmaker and newbie stand-up comedian. She\u0027s Dublin based but originally from County Galway in the West of Ireland. She\u0027s experienced a lot of ups and downs throughout the years including mountains of failure. She even failed her driving test...before she left the centre. But it hasn\u0027t been all bad. She\u0027s also met some amazing people, experienced a lot of laughs, had the craic (of the Irish kind) and had some successes along the\u00A0way. Comedy and creativity transformed Claire\u0027s life and in the tough times they\u0027ve been the two things that have gotten her through.

As your can hear from my voice I am so rusty and nervous but I felt that it was time to get back to doing something which I find to be exciting. Not long ago my father passed away. I always looked up to him and seeing him helpless on his deathbed sort of woke me up on the need to give life my best and to follow my dad\u0027s example of putting love in everything he did.  At the end of this episode I put a challenge on my listeners to try to practice doing an act of love throughout the day or throughout the week. I\u0027m still new at this so please be patient as I work on my podcast speaking skills.

I am not a expert or doctor of psychology or anything like that however in this podcast I simply share what my experiences were after living in a cult environment for over a decade. The ways religious abuse was justified in my environment might not be what you have experienced however I feel it is necessary for me to share my story so that these forms of manipulation can be discovered sooner.\u00A0  ---   Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/ryan-anthony-hernandez/support",

It had been a long journey and I am still trying my best to love my genuine self. I thank God for sending me friends like Claudia M.

Bing however are still in the dark and are unable to see the lack of transparency of the Founder. Fr. Bing, it is high time that you make a public apology, along with other members who were abusive as well to do the same.

      "description": "As I was leaving the religious life I was approached by two religious members from my community. One of them was offering me his prayers, support and wishing me the best. The other member tried to shame me and put me down which resulted in me putting my foot down that his behavior towards me would not be tolerated anymore. Towards the end of this podcast I call out the members who have been cult like by brainwashing their members and manipulating people that they come clean and be transparent with the church and with the people instead of always running or making up stories. The truth needs to come out.  ---   Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/ryan-anthony-hernandez/support",

Sadly, many victims of abuse are silenced and shamed. I want to bring hope by sharing my journey and the difficulties that I have been in. For years I had felt all alone.\u00A0 In this episode I also pick up from where I left off in my last episode and describe an incident that really set me off and brought me into a deep darkness. I was beaten for nothing really and felt that I could trust no one in life anymore. I am no longer in that deep darkness and would now like to share my story so that people may understand what is what that I and other people go through in life.  ---   Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/ryan-anthony-hernandez/support",

In today\u0027s episode I share the story when I was sent to a jungle area up in the mountains in the Philippines. At first I was under a superior who treated me well until he was replaces by a superior who loved to slap, humiliate, and physically beat members through the vow of \u0022obedience.\u0022 I had tried to do every thing in my religious life perfectly by the standards of my superiors yet I was always getting punished. I had wanted to leave but I did not know how. This is my story. Enjoy!  ---   Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/ryan-anthony-hernandez/support",

There was one side of religious life that was truly Christian and there was another side of it that was Cultish and abusive.  The Cultish members tried to ruin my life and found pleasure in seeing my sufferings and the sufferings of others which caused me severe PTSD.  Being between the two sides of good and bad members in religious life was very difficult but I was able to hold on to HOPE with the help of good brothers and sisters.  In this podcast I lift up the good members, although not perfect, however, they did so much to help me on my road of healing.  ---   Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/ryan-anthony-hernandez/support",

Entering the religious life as a Catholic was so exciting but by the time I left I was so messed up. It has taken years for me to find peace.
