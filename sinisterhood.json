      "description": "By the late 1970s, the once heralded haven for those struggling with addiction had turned into a multi-million dollar corporation. With its sights set less on saving lives and more on cashing in and accumulating guns, the formerly sterling reputation of Synanon began to tarnish. As soon as they began acting on their violent threats, the thin thread holding the whole group together frayed into oblivion. But the group\u2019s legacy is one thing its virulent dictator couldn\u2019t control. This week\u2019s episode is The Cult of Synanon - Part 3. Click here for this week\u0027s show notes.
