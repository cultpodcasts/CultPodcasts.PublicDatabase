      "description": "If you\u0027ve been a Jehovah\u0027s Witness you\u0027ll know that the religion\u0027s leaders have historically encouraged members to devote as much time as possible to their evangelising work, leaving little time for secular pursuits like, higher education and building a successful career. This can make it difficult to find rewarding work after leaving the \u0022religion\u0022. That\u0027s what I\u0027ll be speaking about in this episode along with Stephen Mather, an ExJW who\u0027s built a successful career as a corporate trainer and organisational psychologist.
