# CultPodcasts.PublicDatabase

This is a repository where a publicly-available set of files will be published weekly that contains meta-data about Cult Podcasts.

The objective is to grow this to include all historic episodes, and to include episodes from a wider range of Podcasts that have included guests talking about their experience, or experts describing the Cultic phenomena.

The data is presented as json files.

See [CultPodcasts.DatabasePublisher](https://github.com/cultpodcasts/RedditPodcastPoster/tree/main/Console-Apps/CultPodcasts.DatabasePublisher) for the source-code for that produces this data in this form.
