      "title": "S5:E4 - Spiritual Abuse Awareness Month: Thriving After Spiritual Abuse - with Connie Baker",
      "description": "Connie Baker, LPC author of Traumatized by Religious Abuse and a therapist who works with survivors of religious trauma, joins Uncertain to discuss what thriving might look like after Spiritual Abuse. This is a nuanced subject, intended to provide hope (not pressure!). Thank you for joining us for Spiritual Abuse Awareness Month in 2024!                                     [00:00:00] I\u0027m Katherine Spearing, and this is Uncertain. It\u0027s Spiritual Abuse Awareness Month, and this is our last episode of January 2024. My guest today is someone who It has become very, very special to me. Her name is Connie Baker. She is a therapist. She has a book for survivors of religious abuse. And Connie was our very first guest speaker at our very first in person event.Back in October, and it was phenomenal. She can speak to the survivor experience in such a meaningful way because she is one. And she\u0027s been doing this work long before I even heard of spiritual abuse.She has so much knowledge and I trust her to address this subject of thriving after spiritual abuse with nuance and care because nobody wants to be pressured [00:01:00] into thriving when you\u0027re just trying to survive and that\u0027s not the point of this episode but this is a glimmer of hope for down the road that maybe someday maybe someday We will be here.\u00A0Here is my conversation with Connie Baker.Katherine: Hello, Connie. How are you? Connie: Good. So fun to see you, Catherine. I\u0027m so Katherine: excited to see you again. For our listeners, Connie was our guest speaker, keynote speaker at the RetreatCon, which was Terzian\u0027s very first in person event in the fall. She was phenomenal. I loved every moment of her. Connie\u0027s talks, but then also just getting to hang out with this person.So if you have a chance to buy her book and oh shoot, I\u0027m totally blanking on the name of your book. What Connie: is it? It\u0027s right, Traumatized by Religious Abuse. Yes. Say it one more time. Traumatized by Religious Abuse. Katherine: Beautiful.Wonderful. Amazing book. Very, very, very practical. A lot of folks [00:02:00] have named your book is just very practical for survivors. And one of the things that we invited Connie to do at the retreat con was speak about. Yeah. thriving after spiritual abuse, which I think so many of us are surviving. Maybe we\u0027re healing.We don\u0027t really talk about like that moment when you get a chance to just kind of come out of that survival space and laugh. And have fun and see the sun and, and it seems impossible sometimes that we\u0027ll ever get to that place. Yes. But, but Connie, Connie is really great about making that realistic. Not, that\u0027s, that\u0027s what I think I loved about it.It\u0027s not fluffy and silver linings. It\u0027s realistic and I learned so much from your talk. So I\u0027m really excited to get to jump into that again. to just get us started and sort of lay a [00:03:00] foundation for discussing what it\u0027s like to thrive after spiritual abuse after we\u0027ve been through this. Could you paint a picture for us of what the impact of spiritual abuse feels like?Like, what does that look like to someone? Oh, Connie: yes, yes, I can. Yes, I can. And before we go there, Catherine, I just want to say, I am so thrilled that that was the first retreat. Like, in other words, others are following. It was so, and I know you probably talked about this in follow up podcasts after the retreat, but it was powerful having all those humans.And I think there was also extra power in it post, well, post late pandemic, whatever we\u0027re calling this thing for people to to. Humanly be in the same space and connect. I think, well, Terry, just remembering it, it just was so [00:04:00] powerful. And so I\u0027m just thrilled that you are hosting. Cause we talked about this when I was there.We both have hosted big events before, you know, in our life. And I know what it takes to put something like that on. What was there 25, 30 people somewhere in that range, you know, and, and to have that. And the spaces that you. Provided anyway, I just want everybody to go to second annual. Yes, everybody to thank you so much.Yeah, no, I just I\u0027m just reflecting thinking back just with you even, you know, yes, just being here with you. Remembering just the. Goodness. And all the things that happened there. Katherine: Yeah, I, I\u0027ve, I felt all of those things too. And just was just so thrilled at, I mean, I just like picture that weekend and it\u0027s like surrounded and like sunlight and warmth in my mind.Like that\u0027s the image. It was just such a warm. Just, oh, [00:05:00] and then that whole idea of thriving after spiritual abuse, like we got to taste it, this can be real. This isn\u0027t fake. This isn\u0027t this isn\u0027t false positivity. This is genuine, you know, just joy, like an experience of joy.And the fact that like, oh, after all, all of us have been through, you know, And in this room and we\u0027re laughing together. Like it was just like, Oh, we Connie: laughed so much. Oh my gosh. And you brought a lot of that. You and your leadership team are just pretty damn funny. And we had a lot of fun with that. And so, yeah, I just wanted to say that when you\u0027re talking about that connection, because it really, it really was, I\u0027m just like, no, y\u0027all sign up for number two, second annual Be there.Katherine: So be there for the second one. Absolutely. Connie: Exactly. Exactly. So anyway, the question he asked me, what is it? What is the impact of spiritual [00:06:00] abuse? Oh my goodness. I think, I think a lot. In fact, we talked about this at the retreat. I think a lot in life domains. I think it helps break down sometimes. Like what is What is happening to me?Because it just feels like an avalanche. It feels like you are rolling down the mountain in an avalanche and you can\u0027t see what\u0027s up down, you know. So I guess I think about, you know, different domains of life spiritually. Oh, let\u0027s, let\u0027s take Let\u0027s take the explosion 1 right off the bat. It can not not have an impact spiritually.And that doesn\u0027t mean that you\u0027re for sure going to walk away from the faith, although that absolutely could and sometimes should be what a person does. That\u0027s it. It\u0027s not just permission. It\u0027s like, no. You find your path. But there\u0027s a big [00:07:00] range of what that means, means, but there is no way there is not huge levels of damage, spiritually.It\u0027s like existentially, let\u0027s take God out of the mix, even, if you\u0027re, it doesn\u0027t matter whether you say, Whoa, I\u0027m not about this God thing anymore. You still have to rewrite meaning purpose. Life after death, the, the, the, what is a human being? I mean, you just gotta rewrite all that. It\u0027s just huge.So there again, spiritually, it, it can be devastating. And often is. Often, for me I think. What am I in decade? I\u0027ve done, I\u0027m over three decades past my primary spiritual abuse and there\u0027s still times I go, okay, still rewriting a little bit of this. Katherine: It went, it went deep. Connie: Yes, it goes deep. So then I\u0027m thinking the impact on the body.Most people don\u0027t get out of it without sickness, or, or [00:08:00] injury, or, we\u0027re connected beings, so physically it can just smack ya. In so many ways, I\u0027m not gonna elaborate, but just to help people think through what is the impact, you know? Then you\u0027ve got the emotional, psychological, which most people go through.first. And it\u0027s like, right, that\u0027s true. Katherine: Yes. Yeah. I\u0027m probably the one that makes most sense. Yes. But as you said, we\u0027re integrated and Connie: it\u0027s going to affect our bodies and our spirits and our whatever we want to call it. So, so the trauma, I mean, you and I are therapists and those listeners who\u0027ve heard, you know, you, you know, your stuff and Trauma affects our neurological system, our, you know, our brain, our body, our thought process, our emotions.And so it\u0027s just, it just is so extensive and pervasive. I think is another good word. Then you get into the social realm. Yeah. What does it do to families? [00:09:00] Oh, . What does it do to friendships, to community, to parent child relationships, to marriages, to partnerships? I mean the social impact and community. Oh, how I was just telling client this, I think two days ago.It was yesterday. We were talking about, she\u0027s like, I just, I\u0027m trying to sort out how to get community. And I could tell by how she was talking about it, there was kind of this framework, like, I\u0027m the only one. Why, why, why is this so hard for me? I\u0027m sure other people have it together. There was kind of this underlying implication.And I said, you just need to know something. Do you know, I have this conversation almost daily. Wow. With my clients. What? How? You\u0027re not the only one. No! Please! Rebuilding, especially if you\u0027ve been raised in the church, [00:10:00] Rick, the, okay, we all know on this podcast. What the toxic streams that run through organized religion.We\u0027re clear on that. But I\u0027m telling you, for better and for worse, they do community like nobody else. Katherine: Yeah, and that\u0027s just the reality of like how to find that type of organic community. Oh! Side of the church that that I think that\u0027s probably the biggest grief for me. And then for so many people How do I get that that\u0027s the part I miss the most Connie: besides trauma recovery I would say community especially if we\u0027re talking about thriving when people are finally Starting to put their head up above A little bit and look around to see the devastation.That\u0027s one of the first questions and it\u0027s one of the hardest. So if Those listeners If you guys are struggling to say, how do I do? Community you are not alone. It is [00:11:00] like one of the core themes after trauma recovery I would say it\u0027s number two of saying how do I get the social support and the community?Resources that I used to have in a church because it is what Organized religion does for the positive. It, it provides consistent meeting places, a common worldview, and a common purpose you\u0027re working toward. And I feel like those three things are just in reflection over three decades of trying to sort all this through.Those are the three things I\u0027ve come down to. A lot of organizations have one or two of those, but the power is all three. And it, This consistent meeting time, again, the consistent meeting time, the common world, commonly held worldview, and doing something, making something together, you know, creating something together.Oh my gosh, like, it\u0027s a powerhouse, I think in a very positive way. [00:12:00] We all know it can go very toxic and all that, but there\u0027s also we, we continue our, I think our souls continue to look for that when we say, I can\u0027t do that thing anymore or in that way. Even if you stay in an organized religion in a church, almost everybody I know says, Oh, my relationship with church is completely different.Like it used to be everything. Okay. So we\u0027re getting all. Yeah. The community topic, the damage is so huge and then it can damage things like your finances. All can wipe out your finances to go through religious abuse or to be religious abuse or either one and then you\u0027ve got career. It can even shift career paths for people.And so my hand, yes, right. Exactly. My career. Yeah. Oh, totally. I would never have gone into this field without without my abuse. Not never, but highly unlikely. Honestly. So, so all these different domains of [00:13:00] life, it can. It can determine where you live, you could make up and have to have a move. So I just want to just to be able to bring all that in and say, you know, the impact is monumental.Right. Katherine: And when you said at the beginning, just like addressing that spiritual part, I think that for even folks who have experienced it we\u0027ll kind of do this like compartmentalizing thing of like, it\u0027s just, I just need to figure out that part and like what I believe now. And, and then maybe, or even compartmentalizing it and like, okay, I am done with God and I\u0027m done with church and I\u0027m moving on.But then not recognize all the other places that that is impacting and try to address that one compartment of spirituality. And so I\u0027m very thankful to you for pointing out all of the ways that this can impact us and that we can\u0027t just compartmentalize and just say the right [00:14:00] spiritual thing.Connie: Yeah, we can\u0027t and we can\u0027t compartmentalize any of them. Even even when you talk about mental. You know, you and I are therapists. When we talk about the mental emotional realm, you can\u0027t compartmentalize that because we\u0027re hooked to physical bodies and we\u0027re hooked to worldviews and existential ideas and money and it\u0027s like, no, you know, whatever it is, that part alone, if that, if our brains and neurological system take that hard to hit, it\u0027s going to have, it\u0027s going to have bleed over into other domains.And so, yes, but I totally agree often. Yeah. Because that\u0027s how our brains are trained to think all spiritual, to be very compartmentalized and say the spiritual is the most important. And I think that\u0027s, I think that\u0027s fine to think that, but it\u0027s not the only. You know, and, and to say, Oh, I\u0027m just going to figure out we can cuss on here, right?Yes. In the spiritual, I\u0027m thinking, I\u0027m just going to say it in the [00:15:00] spiritual realm, get it gathered there. We\u0027ll just make everything. Okay. It\u0027s like, Oh. You\u0027ve taken a lot harder hit than just a spiritual issue and that\u0027s huge. I\u0027m not minimizing it. I\u0027m just saying it\u0027s, it does not stand alone, which is what exactly what you\u0027re saying.Katherine: Yeah. And then I also appreciate you highlighting the financial part too, because I think that that\u0027s a. a place that is sort of a hidden impact of it. And, you know, maybe your career and you like switch jobs or you get a new job or you switch careers or you move or Connie: you or might have to make a physical move.Katherine: Yeah. Yeah. Or you, you didn\u0027t, or your job wasn\u0027t impacted and you weren\u0027t like on staff at a church or something and you were still able to do your job. But then. The physical impact that leads to potentially having to go on meds or, or getting ill, as you mentioned, or having to go to therapy and pay [00:16:00] for therapy.Like, I mean, I just think of like how much money I\u0027ve spent on therapy in a decade. I\u0027m like, I could have bought a house with that money. Connie: So Katherine: much money that I am very. Believe was very well spent. I don\u0027t regret spending it. But at the same time, it\u0027s like that. That is a massive one of the reasons. Yeah.And one of the reasons by tears of Eden, we offer our support groups for free because there are so many other things that people have to spend money on to recover. We don\u0027t want to give you another thing that you have to spend money on in order to recover. So yeah, I really appreciate you highlighting, highlighting all of those things for us.What are some of the initial steps that you have seen people take in that healing journey? Common, common things that people will do. Once they have come out of this really horrendous experience. What are some of the steps? Connie: Oh, that\u0027s a [00:17:00] great question. Well, you know, I\u0027m a therapist. And so 1 of them is they\u0027re coming to therapy is 1 of them.And, you know, and let me say something. I truly don\u0027t believe that therapy is the only way to heal. I truly don\u0027t. I think there are people. And there are resources and there are online resources. There are so many things that can help us heal. And a lot of times people go, Oh Connie, you know that person.Oh my gosh, they so need to go to therapy. And, you know, and, and I\u0027ll be like, I need therapy. Yes, exactly. Well, I, I see why you\u0027re saying that. Yes, indeed. But, but really, There\u0027s also, therapy is one piece of a pie in healing, so, and sometimes it\u0027s a really essential pie, and part of the piece of the pie, and sometimes it\u0027s not that [00:18:00] essential a piece, sometimes people do a really good job of doing their own work using other resources, so what I see is people, you know, what they start doing, part of it is they start actually processing their own story in some way or another, so They\u0027re like, okay, what, what just happened to me?Like, I know I was just in an explosion or an avalanche, whatever we want to call it. But, like. What happened? How did it happen? How did it happen to me? What happened? A lot of times it\u0027s not even clear what exactly took place. All I know, I\u0027m bleeding out an artery and I don\u0027t know exactly what happened.Was, was I in a car wreck? Or was it a tornado? Or was it an avalanche? Or how did I get here? So I think processing this story is, [00:19:00] is another thing that people really start doing when they Just like survive the first initial Blow and saying either I\u0027m distancing myself or I\u0027m getting out or whatever form that takes.I think those are a couple really big things right off the top. They start and to heal and thrive. They start having to make connections with other people who get it. Somehow, there may not even fully be other survivors, although I think that\u0027s super helpful and healing, but at the beginning, it just may be somebody who has a good sense and and will Katherine: validate.That was a big deal. Yes, Connie: that was really painful. Yes, exactly. And that was traumatizing and. Wow, how did you survive that the validation feels like such and and they and I think most people in some way or another start getting educated about it [00:20:00] and that\u0027s the answering what happened and I know my book I always say I wrote to me at 25 years old I wrote saying what girl what did you need to understand that you had no clue about that would have Facilitated your healing instead of taking a decade to think I was going to survive the resources we have now.It\u0027s like, you can\u0027t speed up the process, but you can help it and aid it and keep from getting from. Infected you know, re traumatized. There\u0027s certain things you can do to help healing progress. Well, and I didn\u0027t have a lot of that. So that definition of what happened, how was I vulnerable? I\u0027m a strong, yeah, I\u0027m a strong cognitive person.How did, how did this happen to me? I\u0027m a leader. How did this happen? So, you know, all of those things, I think sorting out [00:21:00] the story, getting validation from other people who go, whose eyes get wide and they\u0027re like, What did you go through? And especially when you\u0027ve got a whole community that\u0027s basically saying, it\u0027s your fault.You know, the whole, if you leave a community, the whole community is like, Hmm, your problem, it\u0027s your fault if it\u0027s an abusive system. And Katherine: that\u0027s a lot of people saying that about you. Connie: Oh, you\u0027re, sometimes your whole world. I mean, everybody that matters. As saying that you\u0027re Paul and I remember telling the story to other people, including my second date with my husband, who is now my husband.There was some good trauma dumping that happened there anyway. And honestly, it was also some important information both of us needed to know. And. And so I remember telling him and him being a pastor, a former pastor, he looked right at me and said, that was abuse. Nice. Oh, there were probably some abusive [00:22:00] elements, but I was, you know, it was my issue.I made some bad choices. Oh my gosh, thank God for my husband, you know, who was like calling bullshit. Yeah, this was abuse. Yeah. And to tell other people outside of the system and watch their eyes get wide and say, they did what to you? They did. And those people who don\u0027t know my story, I was sexually abused by a pastor and then blamed by the church and.kicked out for it. That\u0027s the short story. And so, you know, to hear people, to tell my story, not in those words, actually taking much more responsibility. For what happened and then look at me and say they did what and I\u0027m like, why are you not saying? Why did you do that? Yeah And it\u0027s just so important to have those other people So those are some of the immediate things that come to mind when I think of what people are doing I\u0027m sure there\u0027s a much better list, but those are some immediate things when Katherine: people are processing their story in the aftermath?What [00:23:00] percentage of folks or what? range of folks It\u0027s that process their story, but not just the story of the abuse, because I\u0027m thinking of another domain that this might resuscitate is, is your past and like, Oh, what happened in your childhood that like brought you to this place and how. How are, I mean, I know that that happened for me of, of knowing that the trauma that I was experiencing in the church, because it was so similar to what I experienced in my family, that I was severely, not only traumatized in real time, but I was also being re traumatized, and having to balance that.So, yeah, what percentage of people were, were it impacts their entire life story, not just that part? Connie: I, I don\u0027t see Always, never, every, but I will say 99. 9%. Yes. Katherine: I\u0027m not going to say every person, but I\u0027m going to say most people. Connie: Yeah, pretty much every person. Yeah. Part of it [00:24:00] is because we bring, this is part of brain science, is we bring our paradigm, our neuropathways for positive and for negative to every situation we encounter.And so if we\u0027re, if, If power and control dynamics are already familiar, and if you\u0027re raised in conservative religion, they are. They can\u0027t not be. And the more conservative and fundamentalist, in my view, the more power and control dynamics come into play in the institution and the world view, those are deeply familiar and viewed as positive.And so you, how would you not step foot? Yeah, into a system that loves power and control and eventually misuses it. And so to me, and you don\u0027t understand those dynamics. I mean, you just don\u0027t, you don\u0027t get that when you\u0027re [00:25:00] raised like that. This is, you know, the Bible says, God says, the pastor says it\u0027s, it is.What\u0027s considered by everybody to be incredibly positive, helpful you know, the right thing. And so to bring that, the, all those neural pathways that form a worldview and you put trauma, most of us, 99. 9 percent of us have either trauma with a capital T or a lowercase T in childhood and adolescence, you don\u0027t survive this life without.Massive jolts as a child or adolescent. So then you create worldviews. Around those, you\u0027re bringing them into the next, if they\u0027re not processed well, and most of us take our lifetime to process these well, and that\u0027s not discouraging, that\u0027s just realistic, but we usually don\u0027t have it all processed at 20 years old, and, no, we don\u0027t have it all processed then, and so we\u0027re bringing even previous trauma, and the [00:26:00] familiar feel of how that got there, and, So, yes, we\u0027re, it is, I have yet to sit with a person for very long and say, Oh, this is the sole thing we\u0027re talking about.I don\u0027t even remember ever doing that. It\u0027s like, okay, we\u0027re talking about this, but they start saying, Oh, my gosh, this was a replication of this situation in my childhood. Yes, it was. It\u0027s what we do. And there\u0027s no, there\u0027s no shame in that. It\u0027s just what, it\u0027s how our brains work for better and for worse.This is, I mean, you know, us therapists deal with pathology, but our brain has also given us all kinds of survival tools, how we cope through all of that. So, Katherine: yeah, and those things can sometimes even help to like the process of just like recognizing that something is helping us recognize something is wrong or helping us helping us wake up.And that that those experiences are can also be just really Can be helpful and [00:27:00] and our resources that we can tap into as we are in that healing process, and I don\u0027t want to skip over the healing process as we jump into thriving so I just want to create a disclaimer of like when we talk about thriving.This is, this is like. A way to just provide some future hope. Not as a way to put pressure. We\u0027re not saying you need to be here or you need to be here at a certain time. Connie: In fact, some people shouldn\u0027t be here yet. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don\u0027t want them to arrive yet. Right. Right. You know, it\u0027s, that would, you know, and I use physical metaphors all the time, but that\u0027s like, you know, when I was going through cancer and treatment saying you need to start training for a marathon girl.No, no, it\u0027s not Katherine: that\u0027s the need to get through your day. That\u0027s what Connie: exactly survive today. Make sure you\u0027re getting something in your stomach. Make sure your nausea meds, you know, whatever it [00:28:00] means. It\u0027s not time to do a marathon, but we\u0027re talking about a level. Of robust health in the future that\u0027s possible and that\u0027s where I just yeah, I, I remember at the retreat.I said, how many of you know, I said, how, how does us talking about thriving land or something to that effect because I knew there were going to be people that are going, Oh, shut up. I don\u0027t want to keep flagging. I\u0027m like, and, and good for you. That\u0027s right. Because your system is telling you this is premature and.And just take it as that. Say, yeah, I\u0027ll hear this, you know, have, listen to these two yapping about thriving. But I also think it could be, it\u0027s a hopeful beacon too, to say, you\u0027re going to be able to. And, and some of you listening, I know are, are either on the verge or starting to say, I think I\u0027m past survival mode and it will be your time to hear some of this.Yeah. And, Katherine: and one of the, the markers [00:29:00] of trauma is feeling stuck. And have this vision of like, it will not always be this way. There is a time in the future where you will laugh again, and you will thrive. That can help unstuck us. And that\u0027s the point of this. This episode not to say you should drive. No.Why aren\u0027t you thriving yet? Absolutely not. No, no. Connie: I\u0027m so glad we\u0027re talking about that because yeah, it\u0027s like, no, some of you, and I think it\u0027d be, it\u0027s great for people even right now to take a breath and say, how do I feel about this topic? What? And most of the time, what mixed feelings? It used to, we\u0027re not one way or the other, but what mixed feelings do I have about this topic?And to just, you know, welcome all of those feelings about it and, and honor them as we talk, Katherine: and if you, and if you feel like. This is where you, you leave us and you need to [00:30:00] pause the episode and come back in a few months or a few years. You\u0027re, you can do, you can do that. Connie: Please do that. Exactly. Katherine: Absolutely.With that, what\u0027s thriving Connie: and how do we get there? What is thriving? Well, you know, there\u0027s all kinds of ways to define it. But of course, I, MarkerConnie: a bit of a nerd, you know, just kind of, I\u0027m thinking, what is the definition? And I went to, you know, some good old dictionary, standard dictionary definitions, and I like them.To grow or develop vigorously. Isn\u0027t that a great word? Oh, I love it. To prosper or flourish. Oh, I like the word flourish. Yes, isn\u0027t that beautiful? To do particularly well under specified conditions. That\u0027s another one I loved about. Oh, that\u0027s Yes to do particularly well under specified, you know, because then that gives us options to say [00:31:00] Kinda like a plant.What specific plant food does that plant need? Does it need more light? Less light? Does it need more water, less lot water and to, to allow ourselves, I think the individuality of healing and then thriving needs to be honored. Mm-Hmm. It is not a prescription. Okay. I mean, how often Catherine, you know, this happens.My, my clients are like, how long is it gonna take me to get better? Give me, give me a time frame. Okay, we\u0027ve been doing this Katherine: for a while. Let\u0027s, let\u0027s Connie: Yeah, let\u0027s First of all, with the physical body, it\u0027s much easier to do that, and there are still, you know, doctors still fudge and say, well, you could be up and around in three days, or it could be up to like three months, you know?I mean, there\u0027s, even in the physical body, There are those, this doesn\u0027t always everybody, everybody\u0027s body doesn\u0027t do it the same and you put that in a [00:32:00] brain in a, in a neurological system and the variables are huge. So I just want everybody to, you know, be able to say, this is my journey. I mean, the downside is we can\u0027t say, okay, process your story and month one.Do this in month two, you know, it doesn\u0027t work like that. First of all life happens, right? I mean, yeah So and so to come back and just honor This is my path and something you said earlier to we often feel very stuck in trauma recovery But most of the time and I will say this is most I would say but I would say 19 out of 20 Times when my clients say I\u0027m stuck.I\u0027m like, oh, okay That\u0027s kind of that\u0027s important to look at are you stuck? So let\u0027s take a look. So are you? Exactly where you were a year ago. Oh, no. Not, oh gosh, [00:33:00] no. Oh. Then maybe this isn\u0027t stuck. They hate this. Cause, especially the ones who\u0027ve been with me a while. I feel stuck. Don\u0027t say it. I know. Yeah, don\u0027t say it, because it\u0027s just taking longer than we want to.Yes, we would like to feel better tomorrow, thank you very much. It\u0027s like, so, so, to honor the fact that this takes time, and often if we\u0027re not moving quick enough, we say, I\u0027m stuck. And I\u0027m like, it feels like stuck, but let\u0027s look at actual progress and sometimes I\u0027ll say, are you exactly the same place you were even three months ago.No, Connie, I\u0027m not, you know, I mean, they\u0027re like, whatever, but I want to honor the stuck feeling because it is there, but let\u0027s not call it actual stuck because that\u0027s actually not where we\u0027re at. So how did we get here? Catherine, Katherine: we were talking about, Oh, I don\u0027t know, but I was really chocked up. Connie: [00:34:00] Good.Good. So I just want to go driving. And Katherine: how do we get there? What is, yeah, what does driving look like? And then how do we, how do we get there? That was the original Connie: question. Good. Okay. So what\u0027s thriving? I think that looks different too, for different people. And it\u0027s going to look different than it did before.That\u0027s the other thing. I think we need to accept and kind of reconcile. In ourself, sometimes it is going to look like like the name of the treat was retreat was laugh again, and it\u0027s like eventually laughter needs to be another part of your life again, the ability to laugh hard and laugh freely, but even the laughter and what it\u0027s about the texture may feel different than it did before.And that\u0027s not all bad. Most people when they are really starting to thrive will say. Of [00:35:00] course, I hate what I had to go through, but I actually like me better now. Mm hmm. What, what bigger success is there than that? To me, that\u0027s, and I know that\u0027s my story. It took me 10 years in a very dramatic moment. I write an epilogue in my book, a very dramatic moment.For me to go, Oh, I like who I am and not that it was right that it happened, but there\u0027s, I think it was evil that what happened to me and it should never happen to anybody, but there was a part of me that said that has made me who I am and my gratitude for that was profound and I find that\u0027s pretty consistent and so it\u0027s maybe different.And it likely is going to be different, thriving, than what it used to look like. But I also think thriving is going to have greater dimension, and wealth, and color, than it did before. And that, [00:36:00] that\u0027s, to me, that\u0027s the beauty of suffering handled well. Like you actually get in suffering. I am not Again, don\u0027t hear me saying woohoo for suffering No, a lot of it is needless and should never be there and I don\u0027t wish it on anyone that said I feel like beauty can come from that and Healing and not just okay.I\u0027m better like, okay. I got over it But a sense of oh who am I now that I really love that I didn\u0027t have Parts of me before that are here. Katherine: Yeah. Yeah. It\u0027s a, it\u0027s a a hurdle to get past this like reality of like, yes, this should have never happened. Yeah. Yes. And, and, and this is a, this is a churchy word, this is a Jesus word, but it\u0027s also just a word.I see that rather than like, Oh, justification for what happened or a reason for what happened and rather like a redemption. [00:37:00] Yes. Get to step into. And now we get to claim and we get to say this happened. Yes. But despite it, this is now who I am. Yes. Yes. Resiliency of the survival spirit and the human spirit that is ours to access.Yes. And that abuser or abusive system does not get the final word. Connie: No. We do. That\u0027s right. And that where I love that\u0027s so funny. I I was thinking I hope she\u0027s gonna use the word redemption Because you know the church has Hijacked the word and stolen in many ways and made it its own domain its own territory.It\u0027s not There\u0027s something beautiful about something that word Yes, they don\u0027t own it and for us to say no something could be redeemed something Some beauty could come out of something horrible. And I think that is, that is apart [00:38:00] from and across religious perspective. That\u0027s, that\u0027s just one of those, that\u0027s a, that\u0027s an existential life thing.And it\u0027s like, let it, let it, let it be there. So, you know, part of, we talked about this at the retreat, Catherine, but part of thriving, first of all, I think, to, we need to see our all or nothing assumptions. Around thriving, we, we often, I think, especially when we\u0027re hurting and trying to heal and trying to survive, we see thriving as a light switch.That\u0027s going to pop on 1 day. And, oh, now I\u0027m thriving and even as I say that, most of us who live past. Probably 18 years old, we\u0027ll say probably doesn\u0027t work quite that way, but it\u0027s an underlying assumption that it\u0027s going to be. All better, that all domains of [00:39:00] life will be thriving at the same time, and that it is a steady, straight line toward thriving.This, this, this, these steps, and you\u0027re on it. It is a crazy, twisted, three dimensional graph. And it\u0027s, you know, if we\u0027re saying straight line on a graph toward thriving, It\u0027s a mess. It\u0027s a snarled mess to get there. And there are going to be areas, I would venture to say that even the people who are hurting the most listening to this right now have areas of their life that they are actually thriving.They may not be willing to look real carefully at that because it might feel invalidating, which it\u0027s not but, but to be able to actually there are certain areas of my life that are kind of on track. I mean, my husband and I started dating [00:40:00] fully recommended six months after I was went through the abuse.It actually was exactly what it should have been for us. Yeah, again, not necessarily recommended. But. We, that part of my life was very beautiful while I was bleeding out arteries in so many other domains of my life. Does that make my time with, you know, my courtship and my, even that has a lot of baggage to it, our dating years, whatever, you know, dating time less valuable?Or less than? No, it was actually quite a shining light. Does it make my other suffering less? No, it was horrific. And so, just to, just to look at that and to say, it\u0027s not an all or nothing proposition. And it does to hold that lightly and accept the fact that It\u0027s, it\u0027s not going to be an [00:41:00] all or nothing where all of a sudden one day life is just going to be all easier and all better.Yeah. Katherine: Yeah. Yeah. And I think I really appreciated that visual picture that you provided us at the retreat where you gave us domains on a piece of paper and it was just like a bunch of different blocks of different domains, family, social life, work life, spiritual life, all these different domains. Yeah.And, and you said something to the effect of you can be thriving and have a few of these domains that aren\u0027t thriving. Like you can be thriving in general and then have a few domains that aren\u0027t going so well. And that was like a relief to me because I think I pictured thriving as everything is going great all the time.Connie: Right. Well, I have 12. I think of this the cat out. We\u0027re talking about I give up 12 domains and these are very flexible. These were [00:42:00] my domains. And I said, I remember saying that retreat and people can say, that\u0027s not even a domain for me, or I got different domains. And that\u0027s great. But these 12 domains, let me.Let me go through them real quick because I want to kind of talk about this. Is that okay? Katherine: Yeah, and then maybe I could get, if you have like a PDF or something, I can put it in the newsletter. If they, if I remember, I probably won\u0027t, but no, I have Connie: it. I have it. I couldn\u0027t get that to you. Yeah. So one domain is spiritual health when they\u0027re getting, I kind of referred to some of these earlier physical health.Emotional mental health, of course, isn\u0027t that great that I\u0027d forget that one emotional mental health. That\u0027s the third. And then it in relationships is the domain of family, your significant other friendships. That\u0027s huge. And that can include community like we\u0027re talking fun and recreation creativity.Excuse me creativity adventure are all part of the fun and recreation and then I have a set that I don\u0027t know if anybody else uses, but I [00:43:00] love learning and skill building. I loved I\u0027m a learner my heart. So I love like, what am I doing in that domain? My environment my home, my office, my car.How\u0027s that? You know, how are things there in my environment? And then. I\u0027ve got finances. How are my finances? That\u0027s a domain. Work and career. How am I making a living? How\u0027s that going? That domain. And then I have a, my last domain is life contribution. And that, that, of course these areas overlap greatly.You know, they\u0027re not separate, but just for the sake of sorting. So my life contribution, what do I do just to contribute to this world? You know, and those are ways you do it in other domains as well, but I have it for me because well, I\u0027m in a better place Yes, and I\u0027m an Enneagram three So I forgive me even now so it just [00:44:00] is so when I look at all of these domains I have never That I recall in my whole life on a scale from 0 to 10, 10 being best ever, 5 being neutral, 0 being in the toilet.I have never been above between a 6 and a 10 in all these domains at one given time. There\u0027s always a path, there\u0027s always, it\u0027s a Katherine: neutral. But you would say you\u0027re still thriving. You would say. Yes. Yeah. Even if that\u0027s not, not everything is a Connie: 10. Exactly. I, I\u0027ve got a domain right now that is chronically painful.There\u0027s some stuff family wise, chronically, like, ow, like if it, if it gets to a 3. 5, it\u0027s a good day in that domain. So it\u0027s a painful domain. I want to honor that. Like, yeah, that is [00:45:00] real and it hurts. And it doesn\u0027t hurt less because several other parts of my life are actually above six and, and thriving.And so just to give that example, I think about a time in my life when I was going through cancer where multiple domains Were like, finances, physical health, career, trying to keep together a private practice, all these domains were like in distress. And the friend domain was just freaky rich. It was just like, Oh, I would just add such gratitude around that.So a lot of domains in that time of life, it was. Below a five, but the, the upside was the friendships were just so beautiful and good. So I guess. I want to take away the illusion that thriving means everything is in the positive. [00:46:00] Katherine: Yeah. As we wrap up, if someone is listening to this and they\u0027re like, Okay, I think I\u0027m curling out of that survival, and I\u0027m, you know, my head\u0027s kind of coming up and I\u0027m able to just maybe see a little bit of sunshine.What, what are some recommendations, resources that you would recommend to that person to start moving towards coming out of that survival space?Connie: One of the first things I can think of, and there again, I don\u0027t want this to be triggering because it can have some baggage with it, but this is brain science. This is not religion. And that is gratitude. I think reinforcement of what is actually going well. First of all, to allow validation for all the stuff that\u0027s hurting, like, we have this Western mindset that it\u0027s got to be one cancels [00:47:00] out the other.It\u0027s both and, that\u0027s life. But to go with gratitude, no shoulds here, what should I be grateful for? Get that out of your head. But what are you actually grateful for and if you\u0027re moving toward that thriving, I think that can really reinforce it I have a practice every morning of writing anywhere from six to ten things that i\u0027m thankful for right then no shoulds That\u0027s the big rule.Should I be grateful for that? If I have to ask the question, it\u0027s not going on the list like So, no, but what am I actually, and some days that means I am actually grateful for a warm house. It\u0027s supposed to have a cold snap here in the Northwest over the next couple of days. And I\u0027m like, okay, I actually am grateful for this warm house.Great. So to, to keep facilitating that, that\u0027s one of the first things that comes to mind. And voicing those neural pathways, a traumatized brain has deeply rutted, [00:48:00] painful and negative neural pathways. It just has such, there\u0027s such ruts of just the anxiety of waiting for the next shoe to fall, to, to, for the next bomb to go off, and to start saying, I\u0027m going to reinforce.We\u0027re not getting rid of the risk of hard things happening, it\u0027s real. But to say, actually at the same time, these positive things are very true. They\u0027re just as true as the negative. This is a little quote fight I get in with my clients sometimes. Okay, it\u0027s not a fight. But to say, you know, you\u0027re saying all this negative is true.I agree, it is. And even the possibilities of negative are the truth. I can\u0027t say that wouldn\u0027t happen. But what about all the positive as well? It\u0027s an integrating of those rather than it\u0027s not Pollyanna. It\u0027s not rose colored glasses. It\u0027s an integrating [00:49:00] of actual reality and our brains say, Nope, only the negative is true.And I\u0027m like, let\u0027s challenge that because that eventually becomes unhelpful. For our brains, and so somehow reinforcing telling people about the positive, the ones who are also validating the negative, not ones who are pushing you, Katherine: you\u0027re going to celebrate with you and can hold the both Connie: hand with you.Exactly, without toxic positivity, we do not want that, but so to keep moving there, I think social, you know, we talked about the challenges of. Friendships and community both of those. And I think those are a little different because you can have really good individual friendships without a full sense of robust community.Yeah, but those things help reinforce positive brain function. I mean, we just do better. unisolated. We do better connected with other humans. And so those are some, and there again, be gentle, [00:50:00] take time. It\u0027s just not going to happen overnight. And that\u0027s, it\u0027s a sometimes grueling road back, but worth it.It\u0027s worth the time and effort to say, Okay, well that friendship didn\u0027t go exactly like I wanted. I\u0027m going to keep trying to create and develop positive connections. And I think also we\u0027re talking about spiritual, you cannot push this, but I want to give hope. I\u0027m 30 years down. And so I feel like I have this perspective and I started what they called deconstructing 20 years ago.I didn\u0027t know what was happening to me, my spiritual life, my brain, nobody had a name for it back then. I was just freaking out going, I\u0027m pulling back, I\u0027m pulling back. Is this bad? Oh my gosh, am I going to hell? Ah, you know, and I started. Questioning deeply all this stuff. So I\u0027ve been on this process a long time and there are months and years that you are going to live in limbo in that in, and it\u0027s, it is [00:51:00] so damn uncomfortable.It is. It is so uncomfortable and it is so essential that you do not rush through it. Yes, cut the process short. Yeah, but let me say sit with it in integrity you do finally come out on the other side not not with certainty I don\u0027t think certainty, but I think I can say with some solid ground to stand on I think that\u0027s a better way to put it just personally whatever that is for you you start If you don\u0027t circumvent the process, if you don\u0027t, you know, truncate the process, then you can move on eventually to go, Oh, I think I\u0027m finding some solid ground.For me, that was years of limbo. It was unpleasant. It isn\u0027t for everybody. My brain works slower. It had several decades to rewrite. So it took a long time, but it was so worth it to say, no, you are, there\u0027s hope for [00:52:00] some solid ground existentially slash spiritually, not they\u0027re going to, I\u0027m not, I\u0027m not even interested in certainty anymore but a certain definition of who I am and how I relate to life in the divine.Katherine: Absolutely. Absolutely. Oh, I feel like this, this conversation has been kind of like a, it feels like a little pep talk. I feel inspired and yeah, just, encouraged. And I want this episode to end January spiritual abuse awareness month as just kind of like hope, but not hope of trying to put pressure on anyone to be here, but just to say.One day, one day, you\u0027re gonna be able to laugh again. One day, this limbo, five years, ten years, whatever, you\u0027re gonna look back and it\u0027s gonna be over, like this part will be over, or this, this, this. Season of Connie: this part will be over. [00:53:00] Yes, exactly. Katherine: Right. Yes. This has been so wonderful. I always, always enjoy talking to you as Connie: Catherine.Yes. Katherine: And the end of the episode, let folks know how to get in touch with you or find. Stuff that you are, you are working on. Connie: Yes. So let me get my book out. So I remember the exact title. The title traumatized by spiritual abuse, courage, hope and freedom for survivors. That\u0027s it. And then another subtitle is discover the cultures and systems of religious abuse and reclaim your personal power.So that\u0027s on the front of the book. That gives a bit, a bit of a Idea a range of what is in the book and get it on Amazon. So Connie Baker my website has almost. Everything you need on there Connie A. Baker, C O N N I E A as in Ann, my middle name, then baker, B A K E R dot com, Connie A. Baker dot com.It\u0027s got resources, videos, [00:54:00] probably has this podcast, a podcast I was on before with you. So, resources for people to listen to or look up and, yeah, I think those are the main I\u0027m I\u0027m on Facebook. Come on. Oh, I do have here. This is important. I do have a group of probably I think it\u0027s around right above 1000 people right now and online private.Yeah, I didn\u0027t. Oh, good. Yeah. And and I post regularly. And just to right now I\u0027m giving a lot of questions for people to process their story. So that is overcoming Yeah, yeah, yeah. Overcoming religious abuse community. And that\u0027s on Facebook and I\u0027m also on Instagram and Connie a baker is usually the handles on those to Katherine: find it.Yes. All right. Thank you so much. I will link as many things as possible in the show notes for folks. And thank you so much for being here and Connie: always, always a privilege. Thank you, Catherine. Thank you.",

      "description": "Rachel Bernstein LMFT, MSEd discusses what it\u2019s like working with survivors from high-control groups. This episode is for survivors looking for a mental health professional or for mental health professionals looking to work with the demographic of survivors of cults, high-control groups, and spiritual abuse. University of SalfordTranscript (Transcript is unedited for typos and misspellings)Katherine: Hello. How are you doing today?Rachel:  I am doing really good. How are you doing today? Katherine: I am good. I am a little tired. I went to a midnight book release. On Monday nights, and I don\u0027t ever stay up that late, and I\u0027m still sleeping.That was a new thing for me. I was like, this is what teenagers do. These are not what people who are almost 40 do. But it was fun. It was a fun experience. I\u0027m glad. Very excited to talk to you today. I know you have indoctrination podcast, and you do a lot of different work with a lot of different clients, but the particular demographic that I would [00:01:00] love to talk to you about is the demographic of folks who\u0027ve And cults or high control experiences.And I would love to hear from you, what prompted you to work with this demographic and what was the story that led you to working with this type Rachel: of client? Nice. Okay. So there\u0027s so much to this story. I\u0027ll try not to make it overly long, but Okay, great. No, go for it. Tell, tell, tell whatever. It\u0027s slightly long, longer than it needs to be, not overly.Right. Huh. Right. So, When I was growing up, my, one of my siblings who was eight years older got. Kind of a new friend through a friend, and they started hanging out a lot. Next thing we know, she\u0027s not really spending time at home. She has taken the money out of her [00:02:00] account and it\u0027s gone.Which she had really worked hard for. In my family, we were supposed to work from when we were young. If we needed cash for anything, even to go to the movies, well, you need to earn it. You know, it was like that. So it, you know, we didn\u0027t take spending lots of money all at once lightly. Cause we know how much we had worked to make it and suddenly liquidated gone.And she was speaking differently. She was acting in a very kind of in your face way. And we\u0027re like, what is going on? So then she said that she has this friend of a friend who\u0027s introduced her to this place. It\u0027s called Scientology. Got it. And and it\u0027s a church, but we\u0027re a Jewish family, but it\u0027s not a church church.That would, that became a line in our family forever. It\u0027s not a church church. Like what? I\u0027m sorry. It\u0027s not a church church, but it\u0027s not. So. Because there really wasn\u0027t the idea of a word cult that was known at the time, and this was in the 70s. So there [00:03:00] was no one to call. There were no resources that, you know, the books out there at the time before the interwebs, the, the books were written by cult leaders.Like there were L. Ron Hubbard novels out there about Dianetics and his science fiction books, but nothing about what is Scientology and that it is a cult. And the, the cult books that were out there too, were more about like working with POWs who had been indoctrinated and watching the Manchurian candidate and are like, yeah, fit, but not.So the turning point was. And I learned a lot about this. My, my parents responded different ways to stressful events. My mom was more of a kind of in your face, you have to stop this right now, finger pointing. I mean, that, that does sometimes come in handy, right? And my father instead was the, let me link arms with this person, see what they like about it, see what\u0027s interesting to them.But also I want to ask my questions about what I\u0027m concerned about. So, They had tension and [00:04:00] she had tension with my parents and she said this group is going to teach me how to get along better with, with all of you. And And my friend said she\u0027s gotten along better with her parents since she\u0027s gotten involved.And so my father, in a very nice way, said could we call her parents and find out? Like, if this really has helped, then I\u0027ll say, okay. And she got the number of this person and their parents and the parents said, in this kind of panic tone, where did you see our daughter? Whoa. Right? That was a whoa.And my dad goes, what do you mean? We haven\u0027t, we don\u0027t know where she is. She left home six months ago and she said for the last six months she\u0027s been getting along better with her parents. She hasn\u0027t seen them. So this is the way the group defined getting along better, right? No contact. Katherine: No contact. Rachel: Cut them off.Oh my. That actually startled my sister. She didn\u0027t know. She didn\u0027t know [00:05:00] that\u0027s what that meant. I\u0027m sorry. And she tried to get her money back. That was impossible, but. That you could see the personality change right away, and you could see that being in your face and she was having problems with her friends at school for the first time, too, because she was learning other ways of communicating the Scientology way of communicating, which is very in your face.So that became dinner table conversation. How can this happen that people can just take over someone\u0027s mind and convince them that something is true. That\u0027s really not true. That\u0027s totally the opposite of what is true. And then. Because I then was raised hearing about this and that there are many groups that do their recruiting also on college campuses, and they use front names, I then went to college, and I saw it.I saw these groups with their front names that I had learned, and they\u0027re at the student union, you know, passing out their pamphlets having people join, taking them on weekends, the bus picked up in front of my dorm, and I remember, because I was now cult educated, [00:06:00] I said to these people, Where are you going?And they said, Oh, we\u0027re going on a church weekend. What church is it? We don\u0027t know. Really? You don\u0027t know. And where are you going? Well, we\u0027re going to the mountains. I go, you know, that\u0027s not a place like mountains are these geographical structures and geological entities. That\u0027s not a place. Do you know where you\u0027re going?Is there going to be a phone there? Like, how are you going to leave? And they just thought I was being a drag. And I remember the leaders coming on the bus and asking me who I was and why I was harassing the people who were going. But I thought some of them are going to be dropping out of school after this and needing to show their devotion to this group and not school because that\u0027s what would happen.Suddenly these people were gone. Yeah. And then. So there are just two more parts of this story, and it really is, this is a shorter version. When I then went on to grad school to become, to, to become a therapist, to learn [00:07:00] counseling, there was a, a group therapy course where you learn to do group therapy that turned out to be run like a cult.The leader of it, who was the teacher, used, utilized almost every technique of influence and manipulation. And that was just her personality and I did a social experiment in that class, which was interesting because I noticed. This was the year before my dad passed away the year before I broke up with my boyfriend the year before my favorite dog passed away like I was just on the cusp of going through lots of trauma.Yeah, but until then life had been okay, but we were supposed to share our traumas. And if we didn\u0027t have trauma to share like if we hadn\u0027t gone through abuse or something, we were withholding, we were being resistant to the process. And then I could see people folding like I could see them making stories up just to be liked.And then they would be hugged by the people in the group. Thank you for [00:08:00] trusting us with your trauma and with your, with your past. So people were just crafting stories to please the teacher. I thought, wow, this is happening in a therapy class. I remember talking to my Dean about that. He was actually a little alarmed and I did one of my, I did my dissertation on what happened in that class for that school.That was controversial. But then I, I thought, you know, I want to do this work because there were so few resources for people and. I, yes, I want to do general counseling. I still do some general counseling, but about 80 percent of the counts counseling I do is former cult stuff. And then I start that they were looking for a clinician at a place called the cult clinic in Los Angeles, which was effectively shut down by Scientology.But that was my first taste of harassment, Scientology harassment, which did scare me. I mean, they had. discredited LAPD officers that they hired to harass people to follow people. They were scary, [00:09:00] scary mofos, if I can say. Leaning on my car when I\u0027d come out of the office following me home sending people into poses clients.And I get this note saying, just to let you know, we\u0027re watching and listening and thought, what the hell is this? And so I remember staying home for about a week, my father had passed about a year before this, and suddenly I heard his words, which were, you can\u0027t let the bullies win. That was his way of looking at the world like you cannot let the bullies win.And I thought, Okay, but I need a week. I just have a week. I\u0027m like talking to him wherever he is. He\u0027s already passed. And I had to get myself together and See what my rights were. Yes, we\u0027re not. Take a little break, right? Yes, we\u0027re not letting them win, but I do need a break. I need a break, because they\u0027re outside my house, and I need to know if I\u0027ll be protected.I need to contact the police. And then I went back to work, and I thought, what I\u0027m dealing with in terms of harassment is only slightly what former Scientologists deal [00:10:00] with. And other people from other groups. They\u0027re pretty intense. Yeah. Scientologists are very intense. Really intense. Katherine: Stopping them is intense, right?Mm hmm. Rachel: Yeah, yeah. They\u0027ve complained to my board many times to try to have my license taken away. They, they\u0027re no nonsense, but it\u0027s what happens to me and to a couple of my, you know, colleagues. And, and I think to me, especially because where I started doing my work, my counseling was very close to the Scientology buildings in Hollywood.So I started working with a lot of Scientologists and have continued working with them. So they don\u0027t like me, but okay. So that\u0027s, that\u0027s sort of how I got started in this. So yeah. And then how many years would you say Katherine: that this has been like the folks? Is it kind of been from the Rachel: beginning? Yeah, it\u0027s been since I\u0027ve been doing counseling.It\u0027s been 32 years and it\u0027s morphed over time in that before it really was. It was, I thought this was fascinating. [00:11:00] This was a human rights issue to me, especially the way in a lot of these groups that women were treated and children were treated or mistreated, neglected and, and then over time it morphed to include now people who have been in relationships with narcissists because I would do a talk on cults or something and someone would call me and say, that sounds like my husband.Oh, what do you mean? And I kind of learned from people responding to my words about cult saying, no, that was my family that or that was my relationship. So I realized to now with. You know, with political landscape and so many people having polarized views of things and group think that I think is very scary.That\u0027s happening right now in the world to that I care about this on a micro level and also macro that. As the descendant of Holocaust survivors, I\u0027m, I care a lot about group think and how people can be, kind of, how you get to Katherine: that place. It Rachel: doesn\u0027t Right. Caught up into a ffr, the [00:12:00] torch and pitchfork way of Right.And then also still on the micro person by person listening to what they\u0027ve been through and trying to help them individually. Katherine: Mm-Hmm. Two, two observations. First of all. I noticed that when you were talking to those people who were getting on this bus to go to the quote unquote mountains, and that your father\u0027s approach to your sister, a lot of questions, there was like a lot of asking questions and I sure I\u0027m sure we\u0027ll get into that.In just a minute, but I, I noticed that and then also I do appreciate that you address the fact that like a narcissistic relationship can have that similarity because I feel like I know like in the world that I work in, we have a much better, a broader. view of like what a cult can be, what a high control relationship can be, and what a high control religion can be.But most folks [00:13:00] still think of a cult as like something happening in a bunker somewhere, or out in the desert, and Expanding what that can be and what that high control relationship can be. And there are so many people who experienced that, but then have that very, just invalidating experience of like, nobody knows what this is like.It feels like a cult, but I can\u0027t call it a cult because it doesn\u0027t look like this. And, and so I appreciate that. You made that connection between that narcissist and that cold, cold experience. The impact can be very, very similar. Rachel: The impact is very similar.I think because not every cult is run by a narcissist. Some really are. You know, they have their delusional disorder and they get people into this diagnosis that is called fully I do, which is shared psychosis. Like they invite people who are maybe vulnerable to that way of thinking into their psychosis, but by [00:14:00] and large, I\u0027d say a good 90 percent of cult leaders have a narcissistic bent.And so then. Whether it\u0027s your partner, your parent, even your child, there\u0027s some people who contact me because their children are narcissistic and run their life. Because that it\u0027s the same disorder that\u0027s prompting it, you\u0027re going to have similar techniques. Like they\u0027ve read the same manual. It\u0027s kind of amazing.And, and then when you have similar techniques of, of manipulation, gaslighting, all of it, you\u0027re going to have similar outcomes. So it could be a one on one situation or it could be hundreds of thousands of people. Katherine: Yeah, and that can be helpful for someone who is recovering from that type of relationship, like even looking for someone who has the high control experience when they are looking for a mental health professional.Right. That would be maybe not necessarily just a narcissistic relationship, but someone who has that experience might be able to relate with that a little more. One of the things that\u0027s unique about your story is you didn\u0027t get into [00:15:00] this demographic because you had a personal experience being in a cult.So I think that\u0027s really unique. I feel like everyone that I know who gets into this demographic also had an experience. In it makes your story very unique to me, but then also, what are some things that you have learned over the years from your clients about what they need for Rachel: recovery? Right. It\u0027s a great question.So yes. And it, it is unique that I haven\u0027t. Been in one myself, and I think that\u0027s why I work almost equally with the families and friends of people who are in situations like this or in relational situations like this and have a webinar for them too, because I was. One of those, like being on the outside, needing to figure out how to have these conversations, how to manage the anxiety that comes up when you see your loved one getting slowly stolen away from you.And you don\u0027t [00:16:00] know what this forces that\u0027s on them and how to. See if you can get them back and if it\u0027s even possible and learning about the ways to communicate that are in a kind of counterintuitive way that are specific for this has been something I noticed from my own family, but also now for further doing this work and learning about that.So, right. I mean, what. People need. It\u0027s interesting when you talk about doing this kind of counseling for the people specifically who were in situations like this, whether it is a cult or a relationship that took over their life, multi level marketing, abusive teen treatment place, whatever it was, or is, or having been with a therapist who was dangerous, which I talk about a lot.I, well, it\u0027s unconscionable to me. To use that power in that way makes me mad. And so there are, [00:17:00] there are some things that. Are really important. I think for specifically when people are coming out of this, they need to know that they\u0027re believed because so often they\u0027re made to feel that they\u0027re exaggerating the story or they didn\u0027t get it right.That\u0027s part of the gaslighting that they can\u0027t trust the evidence of their senses and how they are deciphering what happened. And they also will often underplay it. And really downgrade how much they\u0027ve been traumatized because it wasn\u0027t supposed to be seen that way in the group like you\u0027re supposed to just deal with being abused, or you\u0027re, it\u0027s for your benefit.You\u0027re supposed to be appreciative of being treated that way, being selected for something that turned out to be abusive. So. Abuse, neglect get underreported a lot of the time by people who leave. And what helps is defining for them what they\u0027ve been through. Like, Oh, [00:18:00] that actually is abuse. That\u0027s why you\u0027re having nightmares.That\u0027s why you break into a cold sweat when you hear someone who has similar voice to the person who did that to you. I want you to understand yourself and your reactions, and you\u0027ll only understand it if you know what happened to you. And also that it wasn\u0027t your fault. That you didn\u0027t bring it in, that it wasn\u0027t because of you.Because, you know, within a cultic system, as you know, anything that\u0027s good that happens to you is because of the leadership. Anything that\u0027s bad is because of you. Katherine: And because you didn\u0027t Rachel: follow the leadership. Right, because you didn\u0027t follow the leadership. You, or you weren\u0027t feeling it in your heart or whatever, whatever it is, it\u0027s always back on you.So to be able to have a clear sense of who the culprit is, and you can take it off of you is also a really important thing. It\u0027s also good for people to understand that they have strengths, that they have capabilities. That they can live in the world and be successful at it, even [00:19:00] though they have been told that they don\u0027t have these strengths and these capabilities and to have them understand why they were convinced of that and how that fed the.Need of the leader to have you be dependent on them and to never want to leave because you don\u0027t feel equipped to be in the world. I think helping people understand why they were taught what they were taught and how it wasn\u0027t for them. It was right. It was for the control that the leader or the group needed to have over them.That\u0027s really helpful just to understand the source and the reasoning for the things they were taught as truths about them. And I think it\u0027s really helpful to connect people with other people. That\u0027s why I run a support group. So people don\u0027t feel isolated and alone. And I will often talk to people about how they They are having trouble relaxing and resting because when you\u0027re in a cult, you\u0027re going, going, going, you\u0027re doing, doing, doing, you learn that you matter the [00:20:00] least and you don\u0027t have to sleep.And it\u0027s fine if you\u0027re not eating and you\u0027re, you\u0027re supposed to somehow be devoted to the cause. And I try to shift that in my counseling work. So people know they are also the cause that it\u0027s important for them to take care of them. And that that\u0027s not selfish and it\u0027s not being lazy and it\u0027s not having pride.It\u0027s not all the other things that it\u0027s called when you care about you. And that you have to be a good steward of the self in order to then do work that you might want to do that\u0027s in service of others, but it needs to happen in that order. And there\u0027s nothing wrong with you for doing it in that order.And I also, I guess I want people to know that the world outside is actually not going to be as scary and not going to be as critical and not going to be as gossipy, like they\u0027ll have more privacy. There, there aren\u0027t people who are going to give them a hard time about everything. I have Clients who [00:21:00] panic if they\u0027re running even 30 seconds late for a session, or they come on to a zoom call a little bit late, or they come to the group a little bit late.I\u0027ll sometimes see them in the waiting area on zoom and then they\u0027re gone. They\u0027re missing. And I realized they\u0027re panicking because they\u0027re sure. That I\u0027m going to give them a hard time and I\u0027m going to berate them for not showing their allegiance to this group and not showing that it matters enough for them to be there on time, all the things that they went through in their cultic group.And they\u0027re also They\u0027ve expressed to me they\u0027re worried about not showing up for the group because when they didn\u0027t go to things, that\u0027s when they were talked about in their absence and waited and given a hard time. So they were afraid of walking back into what suddenly felt like an unsafe. Situation.So I let people know we do not talk about you. And if someone does want to talk about you while you\u0027re not here, if it\u0027s something positive, like, oh, it\u0027s so [00:22:00] nice to meet that woman last time. And I hope she comes back. That\u0027s fine. And I\u0027ll be happy to tell you about that. But, you know, someone who just wants to.Berate. Not allowed, not allowed. So it always needs to feel safe. You just, if they\u0027re doing this work and learning from people and what makes them so anxious and you just see how much they\u0027ve been mistreated and how much they\u0027ve been under a microscope that has been so unfair to them and has made them so tense and so worried needlessly.Katherine: Absolutely. So I heard you say. Believe them. Let them know that you believe their story. I heard you say, give them like language to name what happened and then validate even that it was like a big deal, like naming it as abuse or naming it as as gaslighting. I heard you say, help them access.Like the internal [00:23:00] resources that they have and access their own, you didn\u0027t say the word power, but their own, their own resources, their own internal resources reframe things. So learning that like outside world is not scary and, and just having that, like a lot of like compassion for. The trauma that results in anxiety or fear or mistrust or anything like that.All like super, super, super important things. And I just think about like your support groups and like the courage that it takes for someone to show up to something like that when they have, a lot of times it is a group. Right. That happened in the first place. And that can be very scary, yet such a huge part of the recovery process to be able to engage with a group again.And yeah. Oh yeah. Again, Rachel: very, very important. Yeah. There are people also who. [00:24:00] Have been in support groups that have really, really been unhealthy. And also ones where they dealt with being in a treatment center that were kind of patterned. Well, they took off from Synanon, which started this this horrible practice.It was a cult in California started a whole horrible practice of something called the game where. You are supposed to berate people in a group. You\u0027re supposed to shout at them, call them things. They would sometimes need to grovel, like walk around on, on their hands and knees to show that they were they knew they were less than or they needed to wear a sign around them, around their neck that would say something.It could say whore, could say anything and whatever they may have been labeled that day. I mean, it was, so it was attack. Therapy. I don\u0027t even want to call it therapy. And so people coming out of that have interesting reactions when I do counseling with them. [00:25:00] And, and what is one of the reactions that\u0027s kind of sad is that some of them think that I don\u0027t care about them because I\u0027m not shouting at them.Translation. I get that Katherine: though. I, I totally get that. Yeah. Rachel: Yeah. Right. That was the justification for someone being cruel. Like, no, this is for your benefit. And so I remember one person saying, I don\u0027t know if this is going to work because you\u0027ve never raised your voice, but it\u0027s like someone raised by an abusive parent, you know, like this is how I show you that I care.It\u0027s, oh, it\u0027s such a perversion of how it should be. Katherine: No, absolutely. No. And I, I mean that I\u0027m remembering how like I migrated to someone who was like a known abusive pastor in the evangelical world is Mark Driscoll. And I remember migrating to him as a leader because he yelled from the pulpit and because he was so angry from the pulpit.And I had without realizing it been conditioned to see [00:26:00] that a strong, trustworthy leadership in it. I was like very just Very disorienting when I realized that that happens and that I like read into that anger as good leadership. It totally, totally, really. Rachel: Okay. Yeah, it\u0027s really terrible. And people get that they, they then wind up sometimes in relationships with people who are really mistreating them because.That was translated as love. That\u0027s another thing to define. Like, what is love? And what can that look like in a relationship? And what are rights? I mean, I remember one time, I, I was flown to Texas to help with the, the raid, which had already taken place on the FLDS compound. And I, I don\u0027t like raids, even though I\u0027ve worked with a lot of people who did feel traumatized by [00:27:00] them, but also relieved knowing that there were people out there who cared about what was happening behind closed doors.Like it\u0027s very mixed thing. So I wasn\u0027t involved in all planning it, but they asked me to come in to, to help to train the social workers who were working with the people who had been taken off the camp compound even temporarily. And they were talking to these women or young, well, they\u0027re really still girls who are these sister wives about rights, that they had rights.And they were looking blankly and and they said, they, they don\u0027t seem to believe us that they have rights. I said, They don\u0027t know what rights are. We have to go back. We have to teach them that there are these things that are called rights. That, that there is things called boundaries, that you have the right to say no or to control your body.But that\u0027s not true in their group. So they\u0027re not gonna believe you that they have these rights. They probably don\u0027t even know that there\u0027s this thing called a constitution. Mm-Hmm. . [00:28:00] That says that they have rights that are legally protected. And they don\u0027t even Katherine: have a Rachel: concept for it. Right. And that if they were to impose those rights, they would be abused or they would be kicked out.And so it\u0027s not safe for them to have them. So we can\u0027t jump in assuming that they\u0027ve had the same life and same education and same exposure. Like we have to educate them about the fact that these things exist. And that maybe that will help them leave at some point, knowing that these things exist, but only outside the compound.Katherine: Absolutely. Absolutely. And I know that. You and I probably come from the same position of just because someone has a credential doesn\u0027t make them someone as as you as you discovered with these social workers doesn\u0027t make them equipped to work with this demographic. But if someone were to be interested in working with this demographic and wanted to.Equip themselves and get the resources to be able to work with this demographic. [00:29:00] What would you point them to and what would you direct them to? And what are some recommendations for things that they could pursue to become equipped? Rachel: Okay. I think it\u0027s a great thing. And yes, just because someone has, has initials after their name doesn\u0027t make them healthy people.And I have seen that and I\u0027ve seen it for people who have dealt with abuse at the hands of psychiatrists who have an MD and You know have these very advanced degrees, but they have a disorder that makes them totally misbehave. So, and, and there are people who don\u0027t have credentials who I think have been great.So it\u0027s still buyer beware, unfortunately, even it\u0027s, it\u0027s important just to be a smart spiritual consumer and a smart therapeutic. consumer. I think what people also need to know is that now there are a lot of people who are running what they\u0027re calling support groups, and they\u0027re not necessarily credentialed people.And some run a lovely group, but they\u0027re not quite sure what to [00:30:00] do when there is an issue. And they\u0027ll sometimes call me like this happened and then someone felt ganged up on and we started talking about someone. Thinking it would be helpful, but then they felt traumatized and like, it can go down kind of a rabbit hole if there isn\u0027t someone who\u0027s had training in how to run a support group.So you want to go to someone who\u0027s had training and also there are people who have left cults who will sometimes run them as cults. That\u0027s how they manage, right? That\u0027s what they know. Yeah. And then there\u0027s a group of favorites and that, you know, and they feel, they know it and other ones are feeling ostracized.It\u0027s very culty and they\u0027re feeling judged. So see how you feel. Know that if you get involved in a group, that\u0027s not your only option. You can go shopping around, don\u0027t owe them anything. You don\u0027t have to keep coming back if it doesn\u0027t feel safe. There is, this needs to be part of. The curriculum for social work schools.Katherine: Oh, my gosh. Yes, right. It does because it\u0027s [00:31:00] so common. Rachel: It\u0027s it\u0027s so common. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve had the experience. And if you talk about this issue, invariably, when I\u0027m out somewhere and someone asked me what I do, there\u0027s at least one other person who\u0027s going to say, Oh, yeah. I was in something or my family member was like, it happens so frequently now that I think it should be curriculum and for people who are learning to to become therapists of any sort.It\u0027s just really not, and it\u0027s still not seen as something really as important as it should be. I\u0027ve, I\u0027ve taught a class at. USC about how to run support groups for people who have been abused in groups. But it\u0027s just, they\u0027ll invite you with just that Katherine: extra awareness of like, they\u0027re coming into this and they\u0027re instantly going to feel anxious because and just that extra layer of awareness that someone who has never had that experience would have no idea that someone would come in to that Rachel: environment.No, right. It\u0027s it is. It\u0027s a niche. And and I\u0027m [00:32:00] just I\u0027m asked when I\u0027m asked, but most of the time not because they have other things that they think are more important to teach them and maybe they are. But still, this happens. And so the there is a program out of England run by Colleagues of mine who are lovely and wonderful have had a lot of experience.It\u0027s through the University of Salford and I think you can take courses online. It\u0027s a master\u0027s in coerce coercion and coercive control. And It teaches you about what that is. I don\u0027t know to what degree it teaches you to do the counseling piece, but it is a master\u0027s in it. So you have a good framework for understanding it.And it\u0027s new few years old, and I there need to be more programs like it. But I think If people want to go to conferences, or if they want to attend like the International Cultic Studies Association conference online, where there is a section that is [00:33:00] for professionals, how you do this work, I do some lectures on it, how you also do interventions how they\u0027re different than regular interventions and, Yeah, just understanding the nuanced differences in this work is important and to understand why those things are important.So I think attending conferences, if you want to learn reading some books, I\u0027m in the process of writing one that is going to be about my counseling work. So hopefully that will be out soon. I hope. And, and. It will be a little bit more of like a how to this is what happened to this person. And this is how I thought to help them.And because that\u0027s missing out there. So, yeah, so I think this program in England and also attending workshops at This at the International Cultic Studies Association Conference, which is yearly, is a good place to start. And and then reading books, you know, from people who are professionals who are talking about how they do this [00:34:00] work.I, because again, there were so few resources I really have learned most of what I\u0027ve learned. From my clients really taking notes, like, okay, that worked better than this. And why understanding it. And, you know, we\u0027ve been a learner of the Katherine: people that you\u0027re working with. And that sounds like that\u0027s part of your story is you learned from the actual people that you were working with.And, and that can be, I think, really empowering to, I think, for someone on the client side of. This person maybe doesn\u0027t understand, but they are, they want to understand and Rachel: they want it. I mean, now I can come in feeling that I have an expertise, which is great, but I also come in with enough humility to know I don\u0027t know everything, which is a really important thing for someone who\u0027s been involved in the cult to see that someone coming in, who seems to have this position of authority is saying.I\u0027m open to you teaching me. Katherine: [00:35:00] Absolutely. Absolutely. Rachel: And I\u0027m open to being wrong. I\u0027m not an actor on you. Right. Exactly. I can know about cults, but I don\u0027t know you. And I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going to work for you. Some of this is going to be trial and error. I\u0027m not going to punish you or, you know, I\u0027m not going to stop treating you because something I provided for you turned out to not be the best thing for you.And you let me know that I\u0027ll be happy that you let me know that so we can fine tune it for you. But yeah, that dialogue does not happen. Katherine: In the cold, like, yeah, like you have something to offer here that I don\u0027t have and like having that kind of relationship when you don\u0027t know and when it isn\u0027t your expertise, but it is something that you\u0027re interested in for something for someone who is.And I, I mean, I encounter this so often just with like [00:36:00] my clients and it typically comes up even just in their first initial consultation of trying therapy and admitted and immediately realizing it\u0027s not helping and it\u0027s not the person doesn\u0027t get them and doesn\u0027t understand and then. to have to go through the process of finding someone, you know, when you\u0027re, when you\u0027re traumatized and when you\u0027re exhausted and we\u0027re just trying to figure things out, what are some guidelines that you can give to someone who is looking for a mental health professional to help them that they can maybe look for just immediately when they.Look on someone\u0027s website and questions that they can ask during the consultation to kind of help them narrow down someone who might be able to Rachel: help. Right. So first, you know, I think you and I are going to be equally reactive to going onto people\u0027s websites who seemed who, [00:37:00] who are trying to come across.Like they have the answer. They are the one. And they need to be talking all about their credentials and how they can provide something that no one else can. That is a huge red flag because they\u0027re never also typically going to be able to admit that they were wrong because they know it all. So if it feels collaborative, collaborative.Like we will work together to help you get to where you want to go that kind of language. Like, I\u0027m going to hold your hand while we kind of muddle through this together. I can offer what I know, but this is something that, you know, I\u0027m not going to be coming in and I\u0027m going to be the expert and you have to listen to everything I say.And so, yes, if it has that kind of we\u0027re working together language. And that I\u0027m open to hearing, and I want to understand you so that I can help you. That is, it\u0027s nice that you get to be, as the former member or the person who\u0027s been through this, you get to be the expert in [00:38:00] that space too, because you know your story.And you know what you feel, you intuit that you need, and you want a therapist to be open to that. It\u0027s also important for people to notice when they first start going to a therapist, if they get the sense that they have to make a commitment for a certain amount of time. That is something I think people should not necessarily agree to cause then you\u0027re locked in and then if you decide that it really isn\u0027t working for you, you might feel like you have to keep coming back because you\u0027re of that mindset of you made a commitment and you have to stick with your commitments, but it only matters if it\u0027s helping you.And so you want it to be open ended. you want to be careful to, to not work with a therapist who keeps changing the subject. Like if you really want to talk about your cult experience or the manipulation that you went through or something that\u0027s specific to your experience and the therapist just isn\u0027t trained [00:39:00] in that.And instead of saying, you know what, you have a book that would be good, or maybe I\u0027ll do some research or cause I have. Katherine: Right. Rachel: And I\u0027ve had therapists contact me and say, listen, I\u0027m not telling you, I want you to meet with my client. We have a good relationship, but I don\u0027t know about this. Can you guide me on this?And can you give me some resources? I really value that. I think that\u0027s really wonderful. So if the therapist is open to learning so that they don\u0027t keep just kind of ignoring when you bring it up, cause it\u0027s not their expertise and saying, well, now let\u0027s just talk about your mother. Or whatever, like the usual suspect.No. And you want a therapist who honors your boundaries. And if you have a therapist who asks you questions and you don\u0027t know if you want to share so much information about yourself, even though in the cult you\u0027ve been trained to share everything with anyone at all times, because you have to If a therapist says, actually, that\u0027s, I\u0027m, I\u0027m kind of glad that you\u0027re saying [00:40:00] no, because you don\u0027t really know me yet and you don\u0027t feel comfortable talking and you don\u0027t know how I\u0027m going to respond to your information.That\u0027s good, then that\u0027s safe. And so what can I do, I\u0027ll ask my clients is what can I do to provide a feeling of safety here for you to let you know that I\u0027m going to handle what you tell me. In a healthy way and something that would feel safe for you. There are therapists and I\u0027ve told people this. If you have a therapist who tells you, who uses either of these two words, which are like nails going down a chalkboard for me, resistance and withholding.Katherine: If they tell you that Rachel: you are resisting or you\u0027re being resistant to this process or you\u0027re withholding information from them. Right. Just because you\u0027re saying, yeah, I don\u0027t know if I feel like force. Yes. Yes. Katherine: And it also indicates that they\u0027re almost taking offense. that the client doesn\u0027t trust them.And someone who is aware of this experience will know it is going [00:41:00] to take a lot for this client to trust me. So I\u0027m not going to force them and I\u0027m not going to push them. I\u0027m going to let them lead. And how much they want to share and even just say that, Ooh, I felt my internal haunches. Yes. Wow. Rachel: Right. And you, and that somehow the client also was told they need to make a commitment to this work. That this work is the thing that\u0027s going to change them. But that is just filled with too much ego and too much stress. And just let the person be and let them breathe and let them bring snacks.Just let them relax. Right. Katherine: . Maybe don\u0027t sip a glass of wine, but having a cup of tea is fine. Exactly. Yeah. I remember one one thing that I think my therapist said that felt me helps me feel really safe was I had mentioned sexual abuse pretty early on in our, our therapeutic relationship together.[00:42:00] And it was probably a good year before I was like talking about something else. And she was like a while back, you mentioned the sexual abuse. There\u0027s a chance that that has some you know, impact on what\u0027s happening here. Like, would you mind sharing about that a little more? And so I did. And then at the end of the session, she said, Do you want to bring this up again, like if it feels important to you or do you want me to ask you about it?Like, would you prefer to bring it up or would you prefer for me to ask you about it? And that just felt, I just felt very empowered with that. And just like, she was like, I\u0027m gonna, I\u0027m gonna leave this in your hands. If you want to bring it up again and you want to talk about it, we will. If you. Want me to ask you about it?I can do that as well. And it just felt, you know, just very, it felt very empowering and it, and it definitely created a sense of safety for me. And I\u0027ve [00:43:00] definitely like implemented that in, in with my own clients too. Just like, is this, is this something that you want to talk about more or do you want to just wait and bring it up?Later when you\u0027re ready and you just giving, yeah, just empowering the client and when they have been so disempowered and teaching them little ways that you\u0027re allowed to take this back, you\u0027re allowed to take this voice back. That\u0027s great. That is great. I, yeah. Is there anything else that you want to share about what a client might need or what a mental health first step?Professional might need in. Rachel: In this process, so starting with mental health professionals, there are going to be times like I\u0027ve, I\u0027ve gotten to a certain degree desensitized to hearing some pretty horrific stories. I was not at the beginning, of course, but it is good if you find that. You know, you want to be open to this [00:44:00] population.Sometimes they\u0027ve been through really horrendous, horrendous things. And so it\u0027s good. It\u0027s important for you to take care of you. And if this really is too much for you, or if it\u0027s too triggering, cause you went through something similar, get more support for yourself. So that you can be able, right. Or you can choose if there are certain parts of this population you don\u0027t want to work with, that wouldn\u0027t be healthy for you.And it\u0027s okay to say that. It\u0027s okay to know that. And then it\u0027s good for you to have a resource list, because I never liked saying no to a client when I didn\u0027t have someone else to offer them, you know, like, how about try this person. And so then if you know that you\u0027re starting out and you\u0027re still very much affected by the things that you\u0027re being told.It is good to have at least three or four other names to refer people to for those cases and really, you know, again, you know, really make sure that you feel protected along the way until you get [00:45:00] maybe a little more able or desensitized. For clients. I think it\u0027s really good to know that, at least the way I talk about it that.They\u0027re the ones having the power in that space, and they might not know it, but I will let people know that like I make sure it\u0027s where it might. I\u0027m not at all I don\u0027t have OCD traits sometimes I wish I had more of them in my house would be cleaner. But Right. But, I measure the furniture in my office, which is a weird thing. That might sound weird, but I make sure that my therapy chair isn\u0027t higher than the other chairs or the couch. Like I want us literally to be seeing eye to eye that we are equals here. And not lording over them just because I\u0027m in my chair, you know, I don\u0027t have power.I will tell clients that I\u0027m going to provide for them. My 31, 32 years of experience, but that they\u0027re hiring me, they\u0027re in charge. If I\u0027m not giving them what they want, [00:46:00] they don\u0027t have to stay. It\u0027s like if you take your car to a mechanic and they don\u0027t fix the problem, go somewhere else. Or say, this is actually not what I\u0027m needing.I\u0027m needing more of this. Like, guide me to know what you would like, and then maybe I can provide that with more clarity, and we can work on defining what might be helpful here. But really, you can call the shots. And you can, you know, you can cancel your next appointment and that\u0027s okay, if you have stuff to do you can, I think it\u0027s also important when someone has been involved in a cult, sometimes they get very attached to the next person who is guiding them and leading them and they can get dependent.And it is my job, I think, to be a transitional object. And it\u0027s fine if people want to be dependent on me for a time, but I will say at some point, even though I know you\u0027re calling me to ask me what decision you should make about something, I would love it [00:47:00] if you, if we could work together where you will feel confident being the one where you can ask yourself that question and feel good about the answer you give yourself and trust it.So I can be that person for a while. But part of the goal here will be to hand the baton back to you, you know, I think it\u0027s an important message. Katherine: Absolutely. Yeah. And not just. I think that that for someone looking for a mental health professional that they can work with to, as you mentioned that collaboration and that mutuality and, and, and someone not showing up in that space and like I am the expert I know.This is what you need, et cetera, et cetera. That that\u0027s a good distinction to make. And, and you can typically sense that a little bit in that first meeting and that first consultation. Not always, but I feel like that\u0027s [00:48:00] something that that will come up. And. Yeah, and I also feel like it\u0027s, it\u0027s totally fine to ask a mental health professional in that initial consultation what are some books that you have read about this?What is, what is training that you have had on this? When you say that you\u0027re trauma informed. What does that mean exactly? Have you had training in that or is it just, you know what trauma is, you know, like, like having that you can ask those questions right out of the gate and and that\u0027s okay.And a good mental health professional is not going to get defensive. Rachel: Right. Even if people want to take a break, like I\u0027ll say sure. I mean, of course I don\u0027t even have to give them permission. They can take a break whenever they want, but if they want to see if they are able to take what they got from therapy and kind of just Use it on their own and, [00:49:00] and feel like they\u0027re able to call the shots in their life and see what they can do by themselves.I think it\u0027s really important to have people have that time. And then there\u0027s no shame in calling me and saying, well, something came up. And I realized I\u0027m not equipped for that thing that just came up yet. So can I come back for a while? And yeah, I mean, you know where to reach me, you know, you have my number if you need to come back, great.But, and then when you\u0027re done with that, feel free to, you know, I also, I don\u0027t mind collaborating with other professionals. So if someone does EMDR, and I think that would be really good for. Client, then I\u0027ll, I will refer them or say, sure, they can go see someone else. The only time that becomes an issue is if someone else is seeing someone who I think is fraudulent in some way, like they\u0027re consulting with their psychic, you know, who\u0027s telling them that they don\u0027t need counseling.They just need to pay the psychic 10, 000 and they will free them of their negative energy. Okay. Then we\u0027re going to have a discussion [00:50:00] about that. But if it\u0027s someone healthy. Who is an adjunct. I think part of the wisdom that we have in this world is knowing who our resources are and utilizing them.And so I\u0027m, I never feel in competition, but I will warn someone if I think they\u0027re getting advice from someone who is taking advantage of them. Katherine: Absolutely. Well, this has been amazing. And I know that. Both mental health professionals and folks looking for one are going to find this episode very, very helpful.If folks want to know more about you and the work that you do, where is the best place to find you? Rachel: Right. So you can listen to my podcast. It comes out each week. It\u0027s called indoctrination. It\u0027s on every platform, as far as I can tell, which is lovely. And I can be reached. All my information is on my website, Rachel Bernstein therapy.com. I\u0027m Los Angeles based, but I work with people all over the world. And I have this support group. That\u0027s every other Wednesday [00:51:00] night on zoom. And I work with families with people who are trying to reach out to loved ones. Trying to plan a way to intervene if they feel they need to do that and doing just general counseling day to day in my office in Los Angeles but mostly still on Zoom.And so, yeah, there are a lot of places to reach me and I\u0027m excited to have people reach out if they think it would be helpful. Is Katherine: your support group just kind of anyone can join at any time or do you have like Is it for like a certain amount of time and you Rachel: just right. Yeah, that\u0027s a great question.So it\u0027s open ended. But I just need to vet the person before because we have had issues with people just jumping on who were from a particular group and they were. spying basically on the group to see if former members of that group were coming to this and wanting to get their information. So I, as a safeguard talk to everyone [00:52:00] first to vet them before I give them the zoom link.And and then I do have right of refusal, like if someone was pretending to be someone turns out that they\u0027re not and they really are there to wreak havoc, they\u0027re no longer invited back, it needs to remain a safe place. And it really has, except for Scientology at the beginning. And that\u0027s why I have that.I have to have that interview process now because of them. But it\u0027s been great and it\u0027s been safe and it\u0027s a really nice feeling, nice kind of supportive, collaborative feeling in that group. But yeah, so people can join at any time. And it, people come when they come. It\u0027s very open ended and which I think people.Value that there isn\u0027t the expectation and I\u0027m not going to contact them. Like what was wrong? How come you didn\u0027t Katherine: come? Yeah, that\u0027s great. And then one final thing you mentioned a [00:53:00] university that has a master\u0027s degree about coercive control I\u0027d love to Drop that in the show notes as well. What was Rachel: the university?University of Salford. It\u0027s in England. And It\u0027s S A L F O R D. They have a program in coercive control. Katherine: Alright, I will look that up and I will make sure that makes it in the show notes. Thank you so much for Rachel: being here. Yes, thank you. Thanks for interviewing me. It was lovely to talk to you.",

All right. How about you? Doing, Katherine: doing well, doing, doing okay for doing okay. Or a Tuesday. Brian: It\u0027s just for the end of the month slash year slash the world is losing its mind. Katherine: Right. I know like there\u0027s been a lot of moments this week where somebody will say something about Christmas and I\u0027m like, Oh, that\u0027s, that\u0027s on Sunday.Yes. Okay. We are, we are still, there is still Christmas. Yes. Well, thanks for joining me. I am really excited to talk to you about your summit that you are hosting and curating in January for Spiritual Abuse Awareness Month. At the time this episode comes out, it will already be January. So I\u0027m really excited to hear about that.I got to participate in that [00:01:00] last year. We\u0027ll be participating again this year. Great time to just connect with other people working in this spiritual abuse, recovery, religious trauma, recovery space, and also. Spiritual Abuse Awareness Month for folks who are not aware is in January. And we were talking before we started recording about when we first heard about Spiritual Abuse Awareness Month.When, when was it for listeners that you first Brian: heard about it? I just learned about it last year because, and I, but to be fair, I\u0027ve only been doing this work for about a year now. I wish I knew about it sooner. And I think we were both saying it\u0027s like, we can\u0027t find who originated this thing. But it\u0027s been around for at least 20 years, which to me is crazy.Yeah. I learned about it because of Aaron hung, who\u0027s an artist who was doing that whole AZ trauma recovery series on her Instagram page. And I was like, spiritually, it\u0027d be some awareness a month. That\u0027s a thing. And then the more I dove into it, I was like, Oh my gosh, this is absolutely a thing. And it\u0027s been around a long time.Why do we not know more about it? Katherine: Exactly. I was wondering too, when, [00:02:00] when did that book, the oldest probably. Documented writing about spiritual abuse is probably the subtle power of spiritual abuse. I Brian: think that\u0027s what I was thinking. Yep. And that was, I think it was written in the 90s. I want to say, okay, I\u0027m going to look for a publication date because I want to be sure.But I remember reading it thinking I was like, did they just write this like a year ago? And it\u0027s like, no, it\u0027s been around for a very long time. Yeah, Katherine: yeah, yeah. And then even just like the reality that PTSD. Was not an official diagnosis until the 80s. Brian: Yes. Katherine: Yes. We\u0027re very new in this trauma world. Yes.We\u0027re all very new to this. This is a new, new territory for all of us. Did you, did you find the Brian: date? Amazon says the publication date is 2005, but that seems late to me. I feel like it was before that. It has a very nice Katherine: cover. Brian: It does! Which is why I feel like it is. So now I\u0027m opening my Kindle to look for the actual copyright date on the inside of it.Yeah, Katherine: maybe that was the most [00:03:00] recent Brian: publication. That\u0027s what I\u0027m wondering. Library, look for the yellow book right there. The yellow book. Yeah. That\u0027s what I call it. The yellow book. Copyright page. 1991. You were right. Boom. Boom. First time. Katherine: First time. Yeah. So I guess that\u0027s the first time that that became something Brian: that.People and for reference to me that feels like 10 years ago, but it\u0027s 32 years ago.Yes, I know that tells you how old I am feel like that long ago, but because it wasn\u0027t it wasn\u0027t Katherine: Yeah, I know because i\u0027m like i\u0027ve lived Yeah, I\u0027ve lived longer in the 2000s than I lived in the, in the, in the, in the 1900s, 1900s or so. Brian: It\u0027s been a while. How dare you? Yes, we are, we are, we\u0027re getting, we\u0027re getting up there.We\u0027re getting up there. Yes, yes we are. [00:04:00] Speaking of Katherine: age, actually I have nothing. Nothing to say about it. I\u0027m just trying to segue talking about broken to beloved, which is your summit that\u0027s coming up and to get us started. I would love to hear whatever you feel comfortable sharing about your spiritual abuse story and how can you, you said that you discovered this word, right?Or this phrase, spiritual abuse, this term fairly recently, when did you, maybe just to start out, when did you first hear the term and did you have an aha moment like many of us Brian: do? Gosh, when did I first hear the term? I honestly don\u0027t even know, but it was probably from one of the books that I started reading that validated that experience for me.It might have been K. J. Ramsey\u0027s book The Lord is My Courage, and I read it more as a, oh, maybe this will help me in a [00:05:00] dark season, and that\u0027s one of my favorite psalms anyway, so, and then I didn\u0027t realize she was going to go into their whole spiritual abuse story, and then I am a person who reads all the footnotes and then goes and finds all the primary resources and reads those, so Katherine: that\u0027s favorite reader.They were like, we put this in here for you. Brian: Yes. Well, and that\u0027s, I love footnotes. So, so because of her, I think is, is how I found the subtle power of spiritual abuse. And then from there, I went down the rabbit hole. I mean, something\u0027s not right. Redeeming Power, Church Called Tove, Try Softer, Narcissism Comes to Church, you know, all these books.And now in the last two years, I\u0027ve read over 40. Five books on that topic, which seems overwhelming because it kind of is, but it all came out of my personal experience, right? So I left my last church in July of 2021. I had been there for just about three years, I think. And I walked into that church.[00:06:00] My wife and I have both moved here saying to each other it would be really nice if this works out And if it doesn\u0027t because we\u0027ve already been hurt before I think we\u0027re done with ministry for a while Which feels kind of crazy to walk into a church saying that like this is the last stop Yes.Basically. Yeah. Not indefinitely, not forever, but for a while, we\u0027re going to just give this a break because we\u0027re done. And so, you know, my story goes back over 10 years now, I think I worked at a Christian college as the marketing, as the graphic designer for the marketing department. I had also attended and graduated from that college, which isn\u0027t unusual.But it was a completely different experience being a student there than it was being on staff there. And I didn\u0027t know what to do with the cognitive dissonance of looking at leaders that I respected and admired Who seemed to preach the gospel and talk about servant leadership and humility and all these things But then I would be sitting in meetings I was like I don\u0027t know who this person is who is so [00:07:00] angry and belittling and demeaning and authoritarian and all these pieces And so finally leaving that environment I need to ask you a Katherine: question, just like following up on that, because I feel like that\u0027s such a common theme of like the, what you preach and what you teach is not who you are.And I just, I just hear that all the time. And just was talking to someone about the other day about her father, who was a pastor and he. He was a pastor and he would preach these things about like parenting and then he would like not be that type of parent. And I\u0027m just curious from the experience that you had what, what is your take on that of like, why, like, you obviously know what\u0027s right.Where, where is this disconnect happening because you can preach it enough to convince people then what\u0027s happening here. What\u0027s your Brian: [00:08:00] take on that? My take for the last two or three years now has been, it all boils down to the need for power and control. And this message is going to work and this message is going to work.And so the secondary or maybe even tertiary word that comes out of that is optics. It all comes down to optics and the way things look and appear so that I can maintain power and control. And so if I can maintain this image of, then I will continue to have power and control and influence over these people as long as they don\u0027t see behind the curtain.And if they do see behind the curtain, it doesn\u0027t matter because I control them anyway because I\u0027m their boss, right? Or because I am their spiritual authority or leader or whatever it is. So I, it\u0027s wrecking. Man, there\u0027s so many ways I can go so the last pastor I had would often say things like when I first started.It\u0027s like you have to recognize the hats that you wear when you walk into a room. So I know that I\u0027m the [00:09:00] pastor. So I know that there\u0027s a power dynamic. So I had to be aware that when I\u0027m leading a conversation or that there\u0027s going to be a shift in something somewhere. But then this is the same guy who would absolutely manipulate that power dynamic.Yeah, or pretend that he was the servant or the victim or the low man on the totem pole is like you don\u0027t get it both ways. Like so. So I know that you cognitively know these things to be true. And yet I see you do the polar opposite. And then use those things to twist them to your advantage. Yes. In the way of whether ignorantly or intentionally, both are worse, harming someone else in the process.Katherine: Yeah, and that is the crux of spiritual abuse and why it is devastating and so damaging and so complex and so confusing is like these people are preaching these good messages that they are aware are quote unquote good messages, but [00:10:00] using that intentionally to manipulate and control people. So then these good messages.suddenly become infused with this thing that makes us just terrified. Brian: Poison. It\u0027s poison. Katherine: Yeah. And we\u0027re just, we\u0027re just like, I can\u0027t even engage with this, even though some of this stuff is really good, you know, that. Yeah. Yeah. And, and, and yet it just causes this. Massive cavern of, of just fear and doubt and trauma.Brian: Yes, I think that\u0027s where a lot of the confusion comes from, too, is because, because so much of it is truth, right? Or is based on quote, good intentions or scripture or whatever it is, but then you see it manipulated and twisted. So now you don\u0027t know what to believe or what\u0027s true or good anymore.Right, and you can\u0027t Katherine: trust good people who are saying absolutely, it\u0027s like absolutely walk into a room and you\u0027re like, are they good or [00:11:00] not, you know, just, just being able to trust, even just what people say and like, and then you\u0027re kind of in evangelicalism and church culture, you like you walk into a church and and everyone\u0027s believing the same thing.Well, Are, are they, are they, are we, are we all on the same page here? I talked to someone the other day that like teaches their children just because someone is a pastor doesn\u0027t mean they\u0027re interpreting scripture actually accurately. And I was like, okay, that\u0027s a very wise thing to teach your child, but so sad that you\u0027re saying.has led you to teach that to your child. Brian: Yeah. Yeah. Same. Well, and I\u0027ve heard, I\u0027ve heard parents and other people just like, because normally we instruct our kids to pay attention or listen to the grownups. And I\u0027ve heard other grown up, other adults and friends say, it\u0027s like, actually, that\u0027s not always true because grownups won\u0027t always tell you the right thing to do, or they might be wanting to hurt you in some kind of way.And it\u0027s like, I hate that we have to teach our kids that, but it\u0027s, that\u0027s [00:12:00] the way of the world today. And it\u0027s just really unfortunate and sad and grieving. Katherine: Yes. When you\u0027re allowed to be afraid of Santa Claus. Yes. Brian: Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Yes. That\u0027s okay if you\u0027re afraid. So trust your gut on that one.Yeah. So anyway, so I went through that experience three times in three different environments. Three times. The first time, not necessarily in a row, but very close. So the first time at a college with an older leader, mentor, figure, admired. Second time with a, someone who very young and then I had a short break for about two years and then ended up where I was now with someone who\u0027s basically my contemporary.But it\u0027s just getting it, getting hit from all sides of it. And I had had enough. So when we left, when I left the church in July of 21, I was like, I am absolutely done for a while and I\u0027ve got to figure all of this out because I don\u0027t know why it keeps happening to me, you know, a result of all the gas lighting is like, it must be my fault.So it must be something wrong in the denominator. [00:13:00] Exactly. And we had already been seeing our counselor therapist for a while. So we just kind of dove into the topic head first. It\u0027s like, I just, I\u0027m in a tailspin. I don\u0027t know what to do. Like, I don\u0027t know which way is up right now, and I just help. Just help.And she, she is a trauma informed therapist, which was extreme. I\u0027m grateful for, because that\u0027s not why we started going to her. But that helped to process all of this stuff and then finding these books and finding these resources and chasing the rabbit holes got me to the place was like, okay, I can name spiritual abuse.I can define it. I can name trauma and define it. And after about a year and a half. Of doing that work and processing through the trauma and the abuse. I was like, I think I might be in a place where I feel like I\u0027m doing better and I\u0027m not doing great, but I\u0027m definitely better than I was. And I think I actually have a framework for how I want to help other people because everywhere around me, I see people dealing with the same thing.And I hate that we\u0027re all here. Katherine: [00:14:00] Absolutely. Did you have, when you were like doing research, did you have something that you, how are you defining it at the time? You just calling it church hurt. What were you Googling? Brian: What were the things that you? Yeah. Well, yeah. I mean, I think it starts with church hurts.That\u0027s kind of the phrase that people hear. And then once I got my brain around the term spiritual abuse, I was like, Oh, okay. And then of course everyone quotes, the body keeps a score. So I forced myself through that one. And then through that one learned, learned trauma and then found books on religious trauma and started doing that whole thing.So just coming up with definitions and just kind of collecting all these in a master Google doc for my brain and figuring it out from there. Katherine: Yeah. Yeah. And then at what point did you say? Yeah. So you said that I want to help people and help make sense of this. Where did the vision for broken to beloved come from?Cause last year was the first year, right? April, wait, I guess that\u0027s this year, right? [00:15:00] Brian: Yeah, it is. Yeah. April of this year. Yeah. 20, 23 at the time. So it didn\u0027t start as broken into beloved. It started as a six week cohort, which I call through, which is based on the children\u0027s book. Going on a bear hunt because we can\u0027t go around it.Can\u0027t go over it. You just got to go through it. Right. And that came up from a friend, Amy. I was speaking at her summit. She does an Enneagram summit and I also do Enneagram coaching, but she said, what do you want to talk about? I was like, this sounds crazy, but. Do you want to talk like, can I talk about like spiritual abuse?She goes, what? We have to do that. And so it just got all my wheels turning and then that\u0027s what kind of turned into the cohort. So I, I created a framework for a six week cohort to lead people. You know, and the story of that is like, because I over identified myself as broken for so long, I literally walked into this last church interview with the pastors and elders and said, Listen, they were like, hey, why should we hire you?And my answer was, well, actually, you [00:16:00] don\u0027t want to hire me because I\u0027m damaged goods. Let me just disqualify myself to you now because you don\u0027t want me because I\u0027m broken and I\u0027m really damaged. So you don\u0027t want me here. And so I recognize that I was wearing that as my identity. And so through KJ Ramsey\u0027s book, through all these other books that identified Wade Mullin, something\u0027s not right and all these other things, it\u0027s like, Oh, okay, so maybe I\u0027m not the problem.Yeah, maybe there\u0027s stuff broken in the system and it\u0027s not to say I\u0027m not blameless for a lot of things because I certainly am but it was Developing a framework for what does it look like to move out of my brokenness and to actually name the things that have happened to Me because we can\u0027t heal what we can\u0027t name.So naming things is really important Recognizing where I am in time and space so that I can pull myself to the present and recognize when I\u0027m safe when I\u0027m not When I\u0027m triggered or activated when I\u0027m not And then using all the polyvagal theory stuff that she includes in there. And then [00:17:00] recognizing how embodiment is so important and breath practices and mindfulness things and moving forward so that we can recognize, identify, and then embrace our belovedness as our actual identity, not our brokenness.So the cohort came first in October of 2022. It went really, really well. I did it again in January of 23, which is the beginning of the year that we\u0027re recording. And so coming out of those two cohorts, I was like, man, it seems like there\u0027s an audience for this and a need for it. And all the books that I have read have done a really great job defining terms for me.They do a good job of validating experiences and telling stories. I\u0027ve read almost nothing that offers what now? Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Like, I just don\u0027t know what to do. Like, okay, great. Thanks for sharing the information, but what do I actually do now? Cause I still feel stuck. So the whole point of the broken to beloved summit, which came from the bookends of the cohort of starting broken and ending beloved [00:18:00] was to invite all the authors that I had read and the resources that I had found online, get them in one place and just say, great.What now? What now? What now? And to make it practical, right? So the whole tagline I use for everything is finding a pathway toward healing and wholeness. When Katherine: you were describing yourself as broken when you would walk into these interviews, what did that mean to you? Was that yeah, expound on what that meant and then how is that showing up for Brian: you?I don\u0027t know if I\u0027ve ever been asked that question. I just felt broken. Like my whole brain was. I\u0027m just unsure of what to believe or what was right or wrong. I\u0027m also an Enneagram One, which is very right wrong, black white minded. I always think I have to do things the right way. So for me It was always a, well, if I was fired from this place, or if I had to leave because I was so toxic, what did I do wrong?But other people [00:19:00] loved me, and it was just this group, so maybe it was, maybe it was them, but maybe it was me, but I\u0027m not sure, and I think I\u0027m really good at my job. And people tell me I\u0027m good at my job, but the pastor just told me I\u0027m not and that he needs to replace me because the board told him so even though they\u0027ve never given me feedback in any of my reviews that anything needed to change when I\u0027ve been asking for them for years.So it\u0027s, it\u0027s all that kind of stuff that in your brain messes with you. It\u0027s also the the second place that we left, we were friends with. The pastor and his wife, we graduated together. We were alumni together. I was like, we thought we were friends. We hung out at each other\u0027s houses. And then to do something like that and to feel so stabbed in the back, really It was a, it was just kind of whiplash, right?It\u0027s like, what, what, what happened there? And so what\u0027s wrong with me and what\u0027s wrong with my relationships? Cause I thought we were okay, but apparently not because then this happens. So walking into this last interview to just say, Hey, I\u0027m damaged goods. I\u0027m broken. I mean, that\u0027s really what it was. And then I had [00:20:00] had two years at another church where I.Genuinely thrived for two years. And I was like, Oh, there\u0027s actually a different way to do things. Yeah. And I didn\u0027t realize that. And then we experienced more trauma. One of our best friends passed away tragically in a car accident. And so that threw everything into tailspin and dealing with the aftermath of that.So it was just kind of like, Hey, we\u0027re really not in a good place right now for a transition or for something to change. And yet I felt so. Bound is not the right word I\u0027m looking for, but I\u0027m going to use it by the whole idea of. If God wants to do something here, I don\u0027t want to close the door and say no.And I don\u0027t say that to over spiritualize anything or myself, but it\u0027s just the words that came out of my mouth at the time. So we just kind of kept going with the process. And I remember the first several weeks slash months of having started this job, just trying to be really vulnerable with people and honest, just like, listen, I, I don\u0027t come here pretending I\u0027m perfect in any [00:21:00] way I\u0027m really broken right now and we need help. Just so you know that, and I might have some answers or help for you, but I\u0027m coming at it from a position of brokenness and the more I do this work, the more I recognize how okay that really is.Katherine: Yeah, and it kind of sounds like as you\u0027re describing. What brokenness was to you? It sounds like trauma, but it sounds like internalized trauma of this is somehow my fault, like these outside messages and this trauma that I\u0027m experiencing is due to something. Brian: Yeah. Potentially. Well, and isn\u0027t that part of the toxic theology that a lot of churches teach is like that you are responsible for your sins and how they label everything as sin.So if something bad happened in your life, it must be your fault because you weren\u0027t holy enough. You didn\u0027t pray enough. You didn\u0027t whatever [00:22:00] enough. Right. And it\u0027s like not. Not taking into account any of the effects of abuse where the abused actually did nothing. It\u0027s like when a woman gets raped, Oh, what were you wearing?How did you contribute? What perfume do you have? It\u0027s like, come on, really? But that\u0027s where I was mentally, emotionally, all the things. Katherine: Yeah, and that thin layer of, like, you must be sinning or God is, like, sanctifying you and is allowing these happen, these things to happen to, like, grow your faith or, you know, and, like, getting to that place, naming, as you said, getting to that place where you just, you\u0027re just able to point out it and to say this was not okay, period.Like should never have happened. We should never should never have had to go through this like this was never an okay thing when you got to your church, the last church and you like was this the church that you were [00:23:00] saying I am broken and I am damaged goods. Yes. And then that Brian: obviously didn\u0027t go did not pan out.Was Katherine: that used against you Brian: was what part used against me? The fact that you were Katherine: open about your brokenness. Brian: Yes and no, I would say by the pastor. Yes, because I think in the kindest way I can say this possible, he\u0027s a master manipulator. So I think he knew us coming in and me saying those things up front and they pitched themselves very much as, oh, well, we are a healing church.We\u0027re a place where people come so they can just receive and sit back and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Right. And but then, you know, six months, two months, four months, two years later, they\u0027re saying, Oh, you\u0027re still praying for that thing. You\u0027re not healed yet. Are you not over that yet? Right? It\u0027s that kind of stuff.And so those are the major red flags that go up. It\u0027s like, maybe this is not such a great place. Katherine: Absolutely. Absolutely. So pitching themselves as a healing place and then, and then not. [00:24:00] Not so Brian: much. Yeah, maybe you used to be but not so Katherine: much today. How would you say? broken to beloved is Creating a space that you would say is just like healthier than that Like how how are you seeking to make that a healthy space for Brian: people?Mm hmm. That\u0027s a great question. Thank you I don\u0027t know cuz I\u0027m still figuring it out. One of the first words that comes to mind is honesty and trying to be honest about Whatever it is that we are feeling or naming or experiencing because one of the things I\u0027ve learned is that when we try to push away or repress any of those things, we often get ourselves in trouble because it\u0027s something is trying to be expressed there.And it doesn\u0027t mean that we. Allow rage or ranting to take place just because because there are safe places to do to do that too, but probably not within a general community, right? Within an intimate relationship, [00:25:00] maybe, but not within a an open space. So I think the honesty piece is one of them. I think the openness is another.Another word that comes to mind is kindness. I think there was an interview I did last year with David Gate, who does all that kind of typewriter poetry, which I love. And he said something that really has stuck with me ever since. And it\u0027s this idea that you can have all these progressive, or not progressive, all these fundamentalist Christians.Or conservatives or evangelicals or whatever you want to call them who go through this process of abuse and or trauma and then deconstruction and then leave the church or whatever it is, but they don\u0027t actually examine or change anything and they just switch over to progressive liberalism or progressivism or whatever it is, and they\u0027re still fundamentalists at heart.Absolutely. And I think the fundamentalist piece, the certainty that so many people carry. Doesn\u0027t make room for curiosity [00:26:00] and kindness which I think embodies a lot of what I\u0027m trying to do is to be open and curious and kind because I also see voices online who just come across as angry all the time.It\u0027s like, I get it. There\u0027s room for that. I\u0027m angry too. But, and there are times that I drive by the church and I\u0027m like, can we just burn it all down? Sure. Right. I feel all that, but it doesn\u0027t, I don\u0027t feel helped or served by it. Yeah. The Psalms, when I did an interview this morning, and the Psalms are 75 to 80 percent imprecatory and lament, so there\u0027s plenty of room for honest, raw emotion, but there\u0027s also a time and place for it, and it doesn\u0027t have to be public, and I don\u0027t, actually, here\u0027s, here\u0027s a good thing, I don\u0027t need everyone to agree with me.Because your experience is your own and you need to figure out how you\u0027re going to process it. Here\u0027s how I\u0027ve processed mine and I\u0027m not going to prescribe anything to you that you should do it this way too. But I\u0027m going to approach it with openness [00:27:00] and kindness and curiosity and hopefully safety.Yeah. Katherine: Yeah. And I think like that. Openness, kindness, curiosity can create that safety and, and, and having that space where people can come on their own journey and find their own, their own, yeah, like find their own, their own path. And, and, and that\u0027s also just sort of like, Anti the opposite of what we experienced in the church of like, only me, the person with the, you know, title can tell you what is helpful and what, what God is really saying and putting that agency back into each individual person is sweet.Not what we were taught church and we were taught not to trust ourselves in the church context. And so, yeah, I love that, that openness, openness, kindness, and curiosity. I love it. What are some of your hopes and [00:28:00] dreams for the summit?Brian: I hope that it\u0027s helpful. I hope that it feels practical for people. I hope that people walk away with a sense of, I mean, the three words I use most often are hope, healing, and wholeness. And I say that knowing that there is real harm done when others try to prescribe a timeline to your healing. That healing is not a destination, right?And I think Laura Anderson just wrote about this in her book. It\u0027s like healing is not a destination. It\u0027s not an arrival point. It\u0027s something that we are just Doing probably for the rest of our lives. So when I say that, it\u0027s not like, Hey, show up to the summit and you will be healed. Absolutely not. But I do hope it gives you really practical tools that you can walk away with and say, Oh, this thing will help me.Right. This thing will help me to take a step. And so we had 1, 200 people register last year, which blows my mind for trying something for the first time. [00:29:00] So I it would be great to have as many or more. Not because of numbers, because God knows I hate numbers because so many churches are driven by it. But the idea that people are helped.And and moved in that direction of healing and wholeness and hope, I think so many of us who go through this kind of abuse or trauma walk away feeling so isolated, broken, like you\u0027re saying, with a lack of agency or not empowered that my hope is that you walk away with a sense of hope, feeling empowered and a sense of agency to take control of something in your life because so much of it has been stripped away from you.I think those are the kinds of things I hope for. Yeah, Katherine: absolutely. And I think even just the reality that we can like walk into a space and it\u0027s, you know, 18 or whatever speakers all speaking on something similar. And so there\u0027s this awareness that like, at least all of these people have, have, have some experience with this thing.I\u0027ve gone through this or understand this and that [00:30:00] validation of like, yes, oh, people are talking about this. And people see this as something that is really important and causes a lot of pain and deserves attention, deserves an entire summit. I think that that in itself is, is So validating and so helpful.What\u0027s, what is some information about this? What can you tell us about how folks can find the summit register if they\u0027re ready for it?Brian: Sure. We do have dates. We will be January 23rd through 26th. Last year was 3 days. I learned that was too short to pack that many speakers talking about trauma and abuse. So I\u0027m spreading it out over 4 days and I\u0027m inviting less speakers. So it\u0027s not so overwhelming every day. If you go to BrokenToBeloved. org slash subscribe, you can join my mailing list, which is where I\u0027ll probably send information first. Or you can just follow me on Instagram, which are where I post when I have time to[00:31:00] at BrokenToBeloved.Okay. All Katherine: right. I\u0027ll all of this information in the show notes Brian: so folks can read it. Thank you. Katherine: And I\u0027m very excited to be there and to be a part of it, watch all of the speakers. And is there anything else that you want to share about broken to beloved the cohort. Your journey, Brian: anything? No, I, I mean, we are like you, a 501 C three.So if you\u0027re looking for someone to support or an organization, this is the work that we\u0027re trying to do. So you can just go to same broken to beloved. org and you can find all the stuff there. I\u0027m super grateful for you and your work and having stumbled across you last year. I, I love and support the stuff that you\u0027re doing as well.Grateful to have you at the summit twice now. Um, And just love doing the work with you.

      "description": "Celebrating Three Years of Uncertainty: 3rd Anniversary Episode(On May 30th, 2023, Seasons 1 \u0026 2 will be archived) Transcript: I\u2019m Katherine Spearing and welcome to Uncertain, an affiliate podcast of Tears of Eden, a nonprofit supporting survivors of Spiritual Abuse, if you\u2019d like to support this podcast and the work of Tears of Eden, consider giving a donation at TearsofEden.org/support. You can also support the podcast by liking, subscribing, and leaving a review.\u00A0Here now is a very short episode to acknowledge the third anniversary of Uncertain.\u00A0This isn\u2019t a journey I could have planned. No one had every done this before, as far as I knew, starting a nonprofit focused on caring for survivors of Spiritual Abuse.\u00A0Spiritual Abuse, that subtle, extremely damaging, often disbelieved form of abuse. Over three years ago, I tried to build a map by attempting to find folks who\u2019d done this work before. My journey through the mountainous terrain of phone calls and Zoom conversations with people across the glob eventually led me to the realization that, as far as I could tell at the time, no one had yet done what Tears of Eden was setting out to do.\u00A0But this journey of discovery, of exploration, still led me to some pretty amazing humans, doing amazing work. I was having insightful conversations and learning so much about spiritual abuse. If only there was a way to capture all these conversations and share them with the world?\u00A0Enter the idea for Uncertain, a podcast intended to challenge the church to do better. At first, we focused on asking the church to stop hurting people, stop putting narcissists in the pulpit, stop using christian platitudes to sideline traumatized people.\u00A0But eventually, I grew weary of speaking to the institutional church. Tears of Eden, the nonprofit of which Uncertain podcast was an affiliate, focused on supporting survivors of the institution. It was never a goal to change the institution. Some folks out there are trying, doing good work, but that isn\u2019t, and never has been, the focus of this little organization.\u00A0So, in season three of Uncertain, we made a slight shift to speaking directly to and equipping survivors, many of whom consider themselves members of the universal church, though often they\u2019ve had to leave the institution in order to start their healing journey.\u00A0That\u2019s where we are today, focused on providing a safe place for survivors to gather and unpack their stories. Uncertain podcast is the main way people end up finding Tears of Eden. This audio format is our number one ambassador for the organization. It\u2019s also our primary resource for providing education and helping folks work through their stories. Some episodes are light hearted, like the episode with comedian Kristina Hart where we discuss the awkwardness of learning how to date as an adult after growing up in purity culture. Some episodes are really difficult, like Kody Purcell\u2019s story of abuse at the hands of her youth pastor. Some episodes are highly informative, full of aha moments, like the episode with Dr. Laura Anderson on how our anger is important for our healing journey\u2014definitely not something we heard very often, if ever, in the church.\u00A0But let\u2019s rewind a little, back to the month of May three years ago. I had planned for the first episode to launch the week of Memorial Day, it was cued up and ready to go, but boy was I anxious. As I mentioned at the top of this episode, I could not have planned this journey. I was Samwise Gamgee from Lord of the Rings, taking that step that would take me the furthest away from home I\u2019d ever been. Most of my anxiety those weeks leading up to episode one stemmed from the unknown. In launching the podcast, and a few months later, the nonprofit, I was entering a world where I couldn\u2019t predict or prepare for what was coming. I didn\u2019t know how the podcast would be received. I didn\u2019t know who the first board members of the nonprofit would be. Heck, I was just learning how to podcast and I had no idea how to start a nonprofit.\u00A0When I think of how anxious I was those first few weeks, how many times I considered bailing, I remember the only thing that motivated me to take the plunge was knowing I\u2019d regret not doing it at all more than I would regret trying and then failing, though I couldn\u2019t have told you then what failure looked like.\u00A0Today, the podcast has been around for three years. 82 episodes and we\u2019re in the middle of our forth season. Over 70 artists, authors, experts, and survivors have appeared on Uncertain. It went from a show with 50 to 100 monthly listeners to a show with thousands of monthly listeners. It\u2019s a show mental health professionals seek out to learn more about religious trauma and recommend to their clients. It\u2019s a show that provides solidarity to survivors when they feel isolated and alone.\u00A0There have been a lot personal challenges associated with this work. As the team that supports the work of Uncertain and Tears of Eden slowly grows, it\u2019s obvious we ourselves are survivors of trauma. Sometimes the work is more than our bodies can handle, and we have to take time to care for our own mental health. I hope an organization supporting survivors of Trauma will always care for the survivors who keep the organization going. Thank you for your patience, compassion, and support, for the times we need to care for and nurture ourselves.\u00A0This is where I\u2019ll sign off, with a big thank you to all of the listeners who have supported this podcast. Thank you for listening, thank you for sharing, thank you for liking and subscribing. Thank you for your financial donations, big and small. Thank you for reaching out to share your stories about how the podcast has impacted you. Happy Three Year Anniversary.\u00A0",

      "description": "This episode is a little different than our normal interview style. Guest is Natalie Hoffman from the Flying Free podcast, but throughout the episode, we\u2019re also going to hear real stories from women who have gone through the experience of abusive marriage and divorce and who experienced the church not only as unsupportive, but also abusive in its interaction with the situation. This is not isolated. It happens far too often. And the church needs to do better. \u00A0Special thank you to Leslie Trovato and Marie Griffith for consulting on this episode. Thank you to the women who sent in their stories for this episode, so other women know they are not alone. \u00A0Gretchen Baskerville\u2019s book, Lifesaving DivorceDivorce and Remarriage in the ChurchContact Tears of Eden tearsofeden.org@gmail.comSupport Uncertain \u0026 Tears of Eden",

And this is also the trailer for season 3, coming in January 2022.But first, a quick recap: in season 1 we spent our time addressing little-discussed subjects related to the church, many of those subjects had to do with abuse, and toxic systems that make abuse possible. In season 2 we added artists to the conversation. Artists are the truth speakers, those accurately naming the present and envisioning where we could be in the future. When it comes to the church needing to do better, who better to invite into this conversation than artist? In season 3, we will continue having conversations with authors, artists, experts, and survivors, but the one twist is we are kicking off in January, which is Spiritual Abuse Awareness Month. We\u2019re organizing a social media campaign to raise awareness about Spiritual abuse, so all of our episodes in January will feature someone actively working in the Spiritual abuse education, awareness, and recovery space. We at Tears of Eden, the nonprofit of which Uncertain is the affiliate podcast, want to invite you to join us, both for the campaign to raise awareness, and also for those episodes discussing Spiritual Abuse\u2014this is a little recognized and as of yet under-researched form of abuse and we really, really hope you will join us. Please pop over to tearsofeden.org to sign up to participate in the campaign. We\u2019re really looking forward to kicking off this conversation in January so I hope you\u2019ll tune in.I\u2019m Katherine Spearing, and this is Uncertain. ",
