      "description": "Growing up as a Jehovah\u2019s Witness was rough, and I want to share my story. In this video, I talk about what it was really like\u2014how it shaped me, the struggles I went through, and why I finally had to walk away. It wasn\u2019t easy, but leaving was the best decision I ever made.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever felt trapped in a strict religion or just want to hear a real, honest experience, this video is for you. Thanks for watching, and don\u2019t forget to subscribe if you want to hear more about my journey and where I\u2019m at now.\n\n#ExJW #JehovahsWitness #ReligiousTrauma #MyStory #HealingJourney",
