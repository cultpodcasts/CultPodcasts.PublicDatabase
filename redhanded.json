      "description": "When the son of Mormon family vlogger Ruby Franke turned up bound, emaciated and apparently covered in blood \u2013 it horrified the police, the internet and Franke\u2019s millions of followers. The uber-strict brand of parenting advice she preached on her YouTube channel, \u201C8 Passengers\u201D, had been drawing online criticism for years. But even her loudest detractors couldn\u2019t know how despicable and unhinged her punishments had grown. That is, until a diary, found among evidence of torture in a windowless basement, revealed the depths of her abuse to the world.

      "description": "If you thought Part 1 was bad \u2013 just you wait. Last week we talked about the origins of one of the world\u2019s biggest cults. And this time, we look at how that influence and control bedded down \u2013 and seduced so many of the most famous people in the world. We\u2019re talking about sex magic, incest, chid abuse, demonic possession, and Fleetwood Mac. It\u2019s time to close the book on the Children of God.

But what made David Berg and his \u201CChildren of God\u201D so unique was the effectiveness of their implementation. In this first of two episodes on one of the biggest and darkest cases we\u2019ve ever covered, we talk about the rise of arguably the world\u0027s most \u201Csuccessful\u201D cult, and what made the man who made the monster.
