      "description": "On the 18th of November 1978, 909 men, women, and children were killed by chemical-laced Flav-Or-Aid in the Guyanese jungle, all at the will of one man - Jim Jones. It was the largest loss of American lives since the Second World War. That\u2019s what everyone remembers. But despite the notorious \u201CJonestown Massacre\u201D being forever etched into the public consciousness, few people know how almost 1000 people ended up living in the jungle, thinking they were fighting the Capitalist machine, whilst starving half to death, and following the words of a meth-addled maniac. This is the first part of their story.

      "description": "Kirk Anderson was abducted from an LDS meeting house in Surrey by his ex-partner \u2013 and ex-beauty queen \u2013 Joyce McKinney. He said he was taken to a small rural cottage, tied to a bed, and sexually assaulted for three days. According to McKinney, everything was above board \u2013 Kirk just liked things kinky. But the British tabloids only cared about one thing: the wisecracking Southern belle Joyce McKinney made for great headlines. All the papers needed was a picture of her naked, to sell the story of the century. And they\u0027d do anything to get it.

      "description": "When the son of Mormon family vlogger Ruby Franke turned up bound, emaciated and apparently covered in blood \u2013 it horrified the police, the internet and Franke\u2019s millions of followers. The uber-strict brand of parenting advice she preached on her YouTube channel, \u201C8 Passengers\u201D, had been drawing online criticism for years. But even her loudest detractors couldn\u2019t know how despicable and unhinged her punishments had grown. That is, until a diary, found among evidence of torture in a windowless basement, revealed the depths of her abuse to the world.
