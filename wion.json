      "description": "A Zimbabwean sect leader and \u0022self-styled prophet\u0022 appeared in court charged with child abuse after police raided his farm and rescued more than 200 children doing physical labour. A police statement said the children \u0022were subjected to abuse as cheap labour, doing manual work in the name of being taught life skills\u0022.\n\nPolice found 251 children on the farm who were not attending school, most of whom did not have birth certificates. They also found 16 graves, including seven for infants, all which were unregistered.\n\n#zimbabwe #cult #wion\n\nAbout Channel: \n\nWION The World is One News examines global issues with in-depth analysis.
