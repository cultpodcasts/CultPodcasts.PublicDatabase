      "description": "* Please consider supporting our ambitous project https://www.tinfoilconfessions.com * Neil is back with another scathing review of conspiracy influencer\u0027s desperate bid for relevance. This time, he takes aim at Laurence Fox and Calvin Robinson\u0027s new podcast \u0022Fox And Father\u0022. Here\u0027s an excerpt! So Laurence has done what many others have done when they piss their career away, he has started a youtube/twitter channel where he can hold a flame to the feet of truth, speak freely without fear of repercussions and possibly get away with using the occasional racist epithet. Like adverts for hot girls leaks, these types of shows keep popping up all over twitter, threatening to infect the audience with their edge lord rhetoric. And like said leak videos they are all just a load of arse. The show is called Fox and Father and I was immediately disappointed to realise that this was not an hour of Laurence being berated by his dad for fucking up his life and wasting so many opportunities. The father in question is Calvin Robinson. Calvin has previously tried to become a Deacon in the Church of England but was rejected due to his controversial and bigoted views. This is an organisation that in the past has defended paedophiles within its ranks, and yet it felt that Calvin didn\u2019t quite butter enough parsnips for them. So Calvin became a Deacon in the Free Church of England, which is recognised by the C of E in the same way that Donald Trump recognises his daughter Tiffany, it sometimes vaguely acknowledges the fact that it exists. In 2023 Robinson was ordained in the Nordic Catholic Church (based in Norway) as a Priest. He reminds me of a talentless Canadian ice hockey player who, having been rejected by every team there, tried his luck unsuccessfully in America, the UK and Europe before settling in the second division of some African league in a country where the majority of people have never seen ice. Robinson has previously been involved with various right wing media outlets and has dabbled in reactionary politics. He too was let go by GB News for sticking up for his good buddy Laurence. I did wonder if the show name might be ironic, an acknowledgement of the hosts reputation and an understanding that many people do not see either of them as \u201Cproper fathers\u201D but I doubt they have that level of self awareness. \u0026#x1f525;\u0026#x1f989;\u0026#x1f525; Some Dare Call It Conspiracy is produced entirely by Brent Lee and Neil Sanders.

      "description": "It\u0027s Movie Night with Greg Hall! In today\u0027s episode, Brent Lee puts the guys through absolute hell and makes them watch Plandemic 3: The Great Awakening by film maker Mikki Willis. Enjoy! From Wikipedia \u0022Plandemic is a trilogy of conspiracy theory films produced by Mikki Willis promoting misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic. They feature Judy Mikovits, a discredited American researcher and prominent anti-vaccine activist. The first video, Plandemic: The Hidden Agenda Behind Covid-19, was released on May 4, 2020, under Willis\u0027 production company Elevate Films. The second film, Plandemic Indoctornation, which includes more interviewees, was released on August 18 by Brian Rose\u0027s distributor of conspiracy theory related films, London Real. Later on June 3, 2023, Plandemic 3: The Great Awakening was released on The Highwire, a website devoted to conspiracy theories run by anti-vaccine activist Del Bigtree. Upon its release, the first video went viral, becoming one of the most widespread pieces of COVID-19 misinformation, its popularity most attributed to online word-of-mouth. It was quickly removed by multiple online platforms, but this failed to stop its proliferation. The video also contributed to the increasing rebellion against health protocols. Due to social media companies\u0027 preparedness for its release, Plandemic: Indoctornation received less attention. Scientists and health professionals have criticized all the installments of the trilogy for their misleading claims, while Willis\u0027 filmmaking style employing various modes of persuasion has been cited as lending to a conspiratorial and brainwashing character of the film.\u0022 \u0026#x1f525;\u0026#x1f989;\u0026#x1f525; Some Dare Call It Conspiracy is produced entirely by Brent Lee and Neil Sanders.

      "description": "Full transcript available at https://somedarecallitconspiracy.blogspot.com/2024/02/jon-ronson-interview-transcript.html Jon Ronson on the Allure of Conspiracies and the Culture War Welcome to an exclusive episode of \u0027Some Dare Call It Conspiracy,\u0027 where hosts Neil Sanders and Brent Lee navigate the murky waters of conspiracy theories with guest Jon Ronson, an accomplished author and documentarian. This discussion delved into Ronson\u0027s firsthand experiences with the controversial figure Alex Jones, the shifting landscape of the truth movement, and the thin line between skepticism and belief. Covid, Clots, and Conspiracy Theories Ronson\u0027s personal health scare, contracting Covid-19 and later developing a blood clot, brings a sobering reality to the conversation. It highlights the tangible consequences of the pandemic, contrasting with the rampant Covid denial and misinformation that has infiltrated conspiracy circles. The discussion pivots to the pathological persistence of some conspiracy theorists who refuse to acknowledge their role in spreading harmful misinformation. Examining Alex Jones: A Turn of Perspective Ronson provides a unique perspective on Alex Jones, painting a picture of a man who consistently doubles down on conspiracy theories, potentially for personal gain rather than seeking truth. His recount of the infamous Bohemian Grove event illustrates the complexities and the theatrics of conspiracy narratives. This segues into a discussion of how some figures within the conspiracy community, including Jones, monetize and weaponize uncertainty to their advantage. Cultural Wars and Class Struggles: The Role of Identity Politics The podcast also touches on the cultural wars that are fueled by identity politics and class struggles. The hosts and Ronson debate how these divisive issues distract from the underlying socioeconomic inequalities that benefit the wealthy. They discuss the often-misunderstood or overstated elements of the culture war, designed to generate conflict and division. The Hero\u0027s Journey of Conspiracy Theorists Joseph Campbell\u0027s hero\u0027s journey is a concept that resonates deeply with conspiracy theorists. Ronson\u0027s exploration of this narrative shows that many within the conspiracy community view themselves as reluctant heroes, engaged in an epic struggle against the perceived dragons of society, such as government overreach and hidden crimes. The Skeptic\u0027s Path: From Belief to Disillusionment Sanders and Lee, formerly firm believers in conspiracy theories, share their journeys towards skepticism. They explore the pivotal moments that altered their views, shedding light on the internal conflicts that challenge staunch conspiracy theorists. This transformation from believer to skeptic is rare in a community where doubling down is the norm, providing valuable insights into the psychology of belief systems. In the end, the conversation with Jon Ronson throws a spotlight on the complex, and often contradictory, world of conspiracy theories. Whether as pronounced heroes on a valiant quest or vilified purveyors of falsehoods, conspiracy theorists occupy a controversial space in the collective consciousness. \u0027Some Dare Call It Conspiracy\u0027 invites listeners to critically engage with these narratives and consider their profound impact on society. \u0026#x1f525;\u0026#x1f989;\u0026#x1f525; Some Dare Call It Conspiracy is produced entirely by Brent Lee and Neil Sanders.
