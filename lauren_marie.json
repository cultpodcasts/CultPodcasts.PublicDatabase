      "title": "Attacked for Leaving a Cult",
      "description": "After 12 years of being in a cult, I woke up and left and today I want to talk about being a whistleblower and the process that abusers will use when confronted. \n\nMy intention in shedding light on this is that it will free someone who watches this to be able to leave, to speak out and to not blame or gaslight yourself for the things that the abusers do to you when you finally become strong enough to leave.\n\n*editors note: At 3 minutes in there was a 16 second audio clip of the leader of this group which we were asked to removed as it is proprietary material\n\nDARVO stands for \u0027Deny, Attack, and Reverse Victim and Offender.\u0027 \n\nPerpetrators often use DARVO to shame victims into believing they are responsible for the abuse.\n\nThe original email series I put out that triggered their attack can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mJx-65bbvOqLjWHFGCIJo3zZO9ulDLSudbvXAVydOgE/edit?usp=sharing\n\nDr. Janja Lalich and her work on Cults, Extremism, \u0026 Undue Influence can be found here: https://janjalalich.com/\n\nJanja works to promote a deeper, more accurate understanding of cults with the intent to avoid their manipulation, exploitation, and abuse.\n\nCheck out and follow the #igotout movement. \n\nThe mission of #igotout is to inspire survivors of high-demand environments who have experienced cultic, religious, or spiritual abuse to tell and share their stories - if and when it\u0027s safe to do so.",
