      "description": "Kenya Hands Over Bodies of 429 Cult Members, its Head Paul Mackenzie Awaits Trial | Firstpost America\n\nThe Kenyan government has begun handing over the remains of the people who were found dead in the Shakahola forest. These people were members of the cult led by Paul Mackenzie and his wife. He convinced these people to starve themselves and their children to death to meet Jesus. The bodies of these people were unearthed by the police who were buried together in groups in mass graves. Some bodies even had internal organs missing. The police arrested Mackenzie in 2023 and charged him with manslaughter, terrorism, and murder. He is currently serving a yearlong jail sentence for illegally running a studio.\n\n---\n\nKenya | Cult Leader | Paul Mackenzie | Shakahola Forest | Massacre | Firstpost America | Eric Ham | War | Geopolitics | Global Economy | Firstpost | World News | Latest News | Global News | International News | Trending News \n\n#kenya #cultleader #paulmackenzie #shakahola #forest #massacre #firstpostamerica #ericham #war #geopolitics #economy #firstpost #worldnews #latestnews #globalnews #internationalnews #trendingnews \n\nFirstpost is an Indian news and media website.
