      "description": "Join the girls on the last installment of the 2023 Halloween episodes, as they discuss an 1850s cult based out of Connecticut... The Wakemanites. Hardworking housewife Rhoda Wakeman suffered abuse at the hands of her husband for far too long, until one day, she claims he killed her. She then went to Heaven for seven hours, where she met God himself, who bestowed upon her a prophetic mission and sent her back to Earth. Using this supposed journey, Rhoda formed The Wakemanites and gathered around a dozen followers, spreading the word of her experience. However, like most cults, the story of these religiously-bonkers people would end in several instances of murder.   ---   Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/truecrimene/support",
