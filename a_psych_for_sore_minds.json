This was after discussion of a recent scandal involving prostitutes. Lloyd Evans won\u0027t apologise to anyone but his wife. After the video, purportedly threatened to sue Andrew Gold if he talked to Lloyd\u0027s ex-colleague and producer (which Andrew did).\r\n\r\nWhat was all the commotion about? Were Lloyd\u0027s actions all the more deplorable given his apparent position in protecting sex workers? Was Andrew right to push Lloyd\u0027s buttons?
