      "description": "In a small hamlet just outside Newtown in Wales stands an old chapel with a graveyard in its grounds. Despite the graves being old they are still treasured by locals who have family past buried there.  Imagine the shock of the locals when one day in July they found some of the headstones had been removed, graves had been dug over and a gravel drive had been laid on top of them  A local resident, Jackie Davies, describes the campaign she has led to expose the inhumane behavior\u0027s of the new owners of the site - Dolafon Gospel Hall Trust, a trust belonging to the PBCC/Exclusive Brethren. Jackie also talks about the unanswered questions of building plans not being available and planning permission being passed without complete transparency of process   \u2018Even when we\u2019re wrong we\u2019re right\u2019 is a phrase used by the PBCC and the attitude of disdain Jackie was subjected to by members of the PBCC certainly upheld this arrogant statement.  Will the PBCC do the right thing by offering a full apology and rectifying the graveyard to its original state or will their entitlement shine through and just do the bare minimum to avoid publicity?

      "description": "TRIGGER WARNING- This podcast contains discussion on sexual abuse.  In this powerful episode, we witness a harrowing account of heart wrenching abuse and manipulation. Ailsa walks us through the sinister web of a controlling relationship and a cult that protected her abuser and still does to this day. Ailsa bravely shares the hardships she and her daughter endured including their walk through the justice system. She has the full court transcript proving the charges her ex was found guilty of, yet the PBCC continue to deny his \u2018guilty\u2019 court conviction and tell those inside that he hadn\u2019t been found guilty.  From a woman\u0027s shelter to a home she has for herself now, Ailsa shares valuable insights and offers guidance to those who may be in a similar situation, and proves it is possible to escape; not just a cult environment, but also an abusive and controlling relationship. She goes through step by step of what you need to make this escape possible. An incredible story of overcoming adversity to live a fulfilling life outside of a cult.

      "description": "Following the PBCC\u2019s planning route in Chicago, they published an unprecedented \u201Cad hominem\u201D attack on former PBCC member and whistleblower Richard Marsh \u2013 who they blamed for their defeat. Here is what they had to say:  \u0022The instigator of the attacks on the Area N project is Richard Marsh, who left the PBCC years ago after he killed a mother of three in a car crash, for which he was criminally charged: Read Story. The courts have confirmed that Marsh is a liar. He has been sentenced to prison in his home country (England) for his repeated contempt of court. Click to read the details of the court judgments against Marsh: Decision 1 and Decision 2.\u0022  Who is behind these multiple court cases against Richard, and what was the purpose of them? Is Richard a fugitive from justice? A wanted criminal? A murderer? Or is this all a desperate attempt to silence a whistleblower who holds the receipts that connect Bruce Hales and his family to a shocking medical scandal? This episode unfolds a sordid tale of greed and corruption within the PBCC, led by fake \u201CCambridge Graduate Microbiologist\u201D Warrick Fentiman, and ably backed up by Bruce Hales in person. The King\u2019s Lynn business Specialist Hygiene Solutions (now re-branded as Inivos) launch Deprox, a miraculous new invention that gives a \u201Cmillion-fold reduction\u201D in hospital room germs \u2013 but is it REALLY as safe and effective as they claim? And why would Fentiman and the PBCC spend millions of pounds on court cases in the UK and Canada in desperate efforts to silence a former employee who worked on the Deprox project?

The battle of Barrington ended in a resounding victory for the residents as the PBCC fled the field in disarray. Never a cult to accept defeat graciously, they then lashed out at their critics in a series of newspaper articles, social media posts and a dedicated website. Having told the Barrington Residents a month ago \u201CWe long to become your neighbors\u201D the PBCC now accuses them of \u201Cshameful behavior\u201D and \u201Creligious bigotry\u201D, and claims that the opposition to their giant 2000 seat meeting hall, school and superstore was \u201Cinstigated by CONVICTED LIAR Richard Marsh\u201D. Lynette Diener, Get-a-Life\u2019s indomitable representative in Illinois was on the spot with her camera at the fractious public meeting where the conflict reached its dramatic conclusion \u2013 making for a truly riveting podcast!

      "description": " It\u2019s a blast from the past as the original founding podcast team of Cheryl, Carman, Lane and Richard get together to celebrate Get-a-Life\u2019s first birthday. Reviewing our year of podcasts, we realized that almost every aspect of the PBCC that we looked at involved the mistreatment and humiliation of women \u2013 so we made this today\u2019s theme.  We look at how women and girls are controlled and oppressed in the PBCC under the pretense of \u201Cfollowing scriptural principles\u201D and show how women even in bible times were accorded much greater respect, power and opportunity than they are under Bruce Hales\u2019 regime. We trace back this distain and male entitlement to the extensive physical abuse meted out on numerous Brethren women by the so called \u201CElect Vessel\u201D James Taylor Jr, and have some shocking eye-witness accounts of his predatory and disgusting behavior. On a more positive note, we reveal the stunning statistics that show the incredible number of views from all over the globe that Get-a-Life has received, and give the top 5 cities around the world for views. A big thank you to ALL our viewers, and our message to Bruce \u2013 if you think we are running short of ammo, think again. We are just getting started! Our goal will always be to save our families in there, from your doctrine.

      "description": " Dr Alex Stein is a social psychologist who specializes in cults and totalitarian groups. In this podcast Alex describes her own experience of being involved in a political cult and the difficulties she had in extricating herself from it. Alex talks us through the emotions experienced when wanting to leave a high control group and describes how support with doing so is vital. She discusses avenues of support and how finding the right type of help is important to aid coping outside when leaving such groups. Totalitarian groups such as the PBCC use the same coercive tactics to control their members as individuals in controlling relationships. Alex explains how this needs to be stopped through the law if possible. She discusses a report published in 2022 that calls for ways in which to amend to law to protect people from controlling groups in the same way individuals are protected in a close personal relationship.This podcast is a must listen for anyone inside the PBCC who has doubts about the regime controlling their lives and who might want to break free.

      "description": " Left alone on the ferry ride to Victoria, our guest Julie Fletcher describes growing up in Vancouver, Canada. After arriving in Victoria, Julie was told she would be going home with The Buck family. For the next 2 years, she describes being separated from her parents, her brother and from everything she knew.  It was never explained to her- what happened on the ferry that day that caused her parents and brother to turn around and go back and she would spend the next 2 years wondering.  When her mother returned to the meeting two years later- it was without her father and Julie describes growing up in a PBCC \u201Cbroken family\u201D.   Julie also shares her recent experience losing her young daughter, Haven, to a very aggressive, invasive cancer.  We are so proud that Julie spoke out to help others understand how destructive the hierarchy is inside the PBCC.  When you would expect compassion and fatherly love she received judgement and disdain.  How has that affected her and what scars does she carry?

      "description": " Anna Simmons lived her whole life in the Exclusive Brethren/PBCC, but never agreed with their harsh doctrine of separation. She was unable to leave because of her family, but spent years having secret contact with relatives on the outside. In one letter she said she had \u201Cfelt trapped for most of my life\u201D, and she also said she felt like a \u201Cprisoner of hope\u201D.  Many people who have left or are thinking about leaving the PBCC will relate to this quote from Anna: \u0022CAN I continue where I am, wearing the mask of conformity, and rebelling within?\u0022  Anna died last week aged 85, the day Bruce Hales arrived in New Zealand for the infamous Palmy Party. It was bad timing for the Brethren! You see, Anna was the grandmother of Lindy Jacomb and Braden Simmons, and great-aunt of Craig Hoyle - three of the biggest \u201Copposers\u201D in New Zealand these days. So what was going to happen at her funeral?  In this surprising podcast, Lindy and Craig reveal how the Brethren compromised on all of their usual burial rules, and even allowed a completely \u201Cworldly\u201D funeral service to be held for her in a non-Brethren chapel. Here at Get A Life we\u2019re hopeful that this sets a precedent for how Brethren funerals will be conducted in the future. Have a listen! We also give a Palmerston North update!

With over 8000 members and many highly successful businesses, the PB Kiwis have considerable soft power within the \u201Cecosystem\u201D \u2013 yet they have never produced an universal leader. Is the harsh and increasingly eccentric reign of brash Australian Bruce D Hales going to be the last straw for the beautiful islands of Aotearoa? Are they preparing to throw off the chains of Hales and go their own sweet way? Was the Palmy Party a desperate, last ditch attempt to woo them back into Bruce\u2019s sweaty embrace?

      "description": " Have you ever wondered- how accurate all the stories told to us and shared with us are? In this episode, we share pieces of a JHS documentary that rewrites history into lies. History is about understanding facts and learning lessons of what not to do and the mistakes that should never be repeated. What then, when we find a group claiming to be a \u0022Mainstream Christian Church\u0022 and we discover them making their own documentaries to sell to their people and they have rewritten history, altered facts, and whitewashed the lessons of past tragedy. On this podcast, being we had the certified facts and were alerted to the dishonesty, we have dedicated this time to share the PBCC version vs the actual facts.  The problem with them rewriting history - making it sound prettier, not as nasty, not as bad, - is that in addition to being offensive and inaccurate, it inflicts harm on victims that have lived through the terrible tragedy in the first place and then are forced to stand up again and say- ENOUGH!! This is a warning for all PBCC members- check the stories you are being told; the facts are being altered and the storyline is changed.  The lessons that should have been learned and etched in our hearts are been whitewashed with waves of false retelling.

      "description": " Residents of the Chicago suburb of Barrington turned to the Get-a-Life team for help when the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church came to town. The secretive cult is trying to secure a 32 acre site in Barrington for a huge complex of a 2000 seater hall, a school and a superstore. Rather than make an honest approach, we believe that the PBCC corrupted two Barrington Park district Councilors with offers of multi-million-dollar realty deals to induce them to push through the sale of the site at a fraction of market value. The PBCC then sent a delegation to the public meeting about the land who lied egregiously about their intentions, and the capacity of the proposed room. Watch Steve Johnstone and Dale Diener fumble their way through a highly charged meeting of Barrington residents. We can\u0027t quite figure out why they were chosen for this - maybe it could be that Dale Diener was a former employer of Unispace and his direct connection to the Hales team placed him there?  Get-a-Life was represented at the meeting by Lynette Diener \u2013 a Chicago resident and former member who has been quietly helping the team for over a year.  When the public meeting erupted in protest, the PBCC them tried to push the sale through BEFORE a scheduled second meeting at which the issue was to be decided. Barrington residents legally blocked the sale, whereupon the PBCC hired a top flight lawyer specializing in religious freedom to fight their case\u2026meanwhile a public protest was held, with \u201CNo PBCC\u201D posters and placards, all filmed by national news networks on the ground and from a helicopter. The drama continues, but here we present the first of two or more podcasts that take you right to the front line of the fight against this insanely wealthy and ruthless cult. We added the updated survivor video as a harsh reminder of the mess the PBCC leave in it\u0027s trail.

      "description": " The Plymouth Brethren Christian Church plan to build a 17,000sq ft church, plus a school and superstore in Barrington IL, a suburb of Chicago. here a former member of the PBCC explains exactly what a PBCC \u0022church\u0022 will look like, and exposes the PBCC representative Dale Diener\u0027s lie that the capacity of the hall will be only 1000 persons. We also get a tour inside a PBCC meeting hall and the reason for the mysterious sliding doors and outsize A/C units is explained.  We go on to look at Bruce D Hales\u0027 ministry, and explain what \u00224 square feet per person\u0022 means in the context of a 17,000sq feet hall. We look at the \u0022circus tent\u0022 outside a Manitoba PBCC hall, and explain that with each giant \u0022city hall\u0022: the PBCC build, there will be several smaller \u0022local\u0022 halls required.  We look at how the PBCC regard their neighbors, and using quotes from their own printed literature, expose the two-faced way in which they seem to offer a friendly hand while despising and hating non-members as \u0022worldlies\u0022. PBCC Campus\u0026Co superstores like the one proposed usually contain a well stocked liquor store. Are the brethren really planning to put a liquor store and a school in the same building? We look at how the Brethren rationalize and excuse using lies and deception to obtain what the church needs from the \u0022hostile\u0022 world, which it regards as satanic.  Any community faced with the prospect of the Plymouth Brethren seeking planning permission for a \u0022Gospel Hall\u0022 needs to study this video carefully.  *Note 1. All ministry quotes are from Subject Index to the Ministry of B D Hales, Copyright Bible and Gospel trust 2014.  *Note 2. Correction: The A/C units in the 17,000 sq ft room shown are not the size of a semi-trailer - they are about 8\u0027 x 27\u0027 - more the size of a  school bus.#plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #OneSchoolGlobal #bully #bullying #meetingroom #meetinghall   ",

      "description": " TRIGGER WARNING- Suicide, self harm, abuse  Join the Get A Life team and our special guest Tiffany as she shares her story, beginning at the age of 6 and continuing through to the present time. A story of callous, brutal, unchristian treatment dealt out without any regard to the feelings and damage being done to a young girl.   Tiffany describes in her own words, how demonstrably more terrible bullying is at the all brethren school, than even the public school she attended prior. The complete lack of any safeguarding policies and the lack of a channel of open communication with a hurting and abused young lady. The complete lack of discipline in the school towards the bullies and even the lack of teaching around bullying and how it hurts others is a common issue we hear that goes on inside OneSchool Global.   Probably, one of the most horrific parts of her story is the details around the brethren stepping in and creating fictious reports and stories so to take complete custody of her child. She shares the abuse she endured from her multiple moves she was forced to do, as she was shipped from home to home. Our message to every mother in the PBCC is very clear- DO NOT allow your child/teen to have priestly visits with men by themselves.   We commend Tiffany on her bravery and courage stepping forward and sharing her story. We know that each survivor story paves a path out of this Hitler like authoritarian cult.

Listen in and be prepared to smile and laugh as his approach to life is bound to leave you inspired to reach for those dreams we were never allowed to have.

      "description": " In February 2009 The Preston Down Trust applied to the Charity Commission of England and Wales to renew its charitable status.  In June 2012 the Charity Commission rejected this application on the basis the doctrines and practices of the PBCC as practiced by the Trust did not meet the test for public benefit as set out in charity law. This resulted in a hearing being scheduled in the First Tier Tribunal so the courts could decide if the PBCC practices and doctrines met the legal threshold for charitable status. That hearing never went ahead.  Join us as we explore what happened as a result of the 2012 decision and unpick exactly what the Charity Commissions concerns were, especially in relation to the reports of detriment and harm resulting from the practices of the PBCC. Regulators are there to give guidance about change and this is what the PBCC assured the Commission they were willing to undertake in order to retain their charitable status. The formal agreement for change happened in 2014.  But have the PBCC changed? Has the detriment and harm to both their members and ex members stopped? If you think not, we explain exactly what you can do about it to call for a review of the charitable status of the PBCC . link to Preston Down Faith in Practice document -https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/336112/preston_down_trust_full_decision.pdf Link to Charity Commission complaints form-https://forms.charitycommission.gov.uk/raising-concerns/ Contact us at info.getalife@proton.me for information on how you can come on and share your story Current GOFUNDME needs Julie Fletcher\u0027s Daughter- https://gofund.me/a9da51dd Heidi McCamley trial- https://gofund.me/5582d1f3paypal  link for USA- https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8Tz4n35OJ8 Olive Leaf Network- https://oliveleaf.network/ Thinking of Leaving Phamplet and resources - https://oliveleaf.network/resources/Link to Anchor/Spotify-  #plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #oneschoolglobal   ",

Behind the veneer of military orderliness and impressive campus buildings, she shows us an ugly culture of unchecked bullying, misogyny, racism and homophobia. She talks about the evidence she saw of marital abuse in the parents, and how it was universally understood by the teaching staff that if they reported signs of sexual abuse to the authorities, or raised questions about the hierarchical bullying, they would be \u201Cdisappeared\u201D.   Former MET/OneSchool student Ben Woodbury, who suffered sexual abuse and bullying at the MET/OSG campus gives us a student\u2019s perspective and in a heartfelt appeal, pleads with OneSchool teachers globally to report abuse to government accredited authorities, regardless of the personal cost.   For OneSchool Global students, their teachers represent their only point of contact with the real world, and their only possibility of escaping from the culture of abuse and concealment within the cult.

Next, we discuss the ban on University education and the narrow minded obsession with commerce that cripples the potential of the students. Finally we look at some reviews of One School Global posted by teachers on recruitment websites, and some pearls of wisdom from cult leader and \u201CMan of God\u201D Bruce D Hales.   We extend an invitation out to all OSG teachers that are currently working or have worked, to come on and share their stories to help these children that have no choice in the life they\u0027ve been imprisoned into.

Sarah describes what happened to her and how she and her family were so harshly dealt with just because they asked if someone could join the brethren to be with her.  Sarah tells us of the treatment her father received at the hands of the brethren and how this contributed to his nervous breakdown. She speaks emotionally of how she was denied the chance to pay her respects to her father after he passed away. Sarah\u2019s story will resonate with many ex brethren as we all have lived experience of their behaviour. But others who haven\u2019t experience such behaviour, may be shocked at the harm and suffering caused just because an outsider wanted to join this church. It gives weight to the conclusion that outsiders are not welcome in the brethren.   The brethren claim to be a \u2018Mainstream Christian Church\u2019.

Jono has truly experienced the worst from this cultic group.

How do we get through to parents that need to protect their children vs following a \u0022Man of God\u0022? Abi and Anne sit down with the founder of Something To Say, Jeremy Indika, who dives into his pursuit of bringing a very taboo subject to the public in any way he can. Jeremy, being a survivor himself, offers advice to the current systemic sexual abuse inside the PBCC. Jeremy\u0027s passion of his mission, \u0022to get this subject on everyone\u0027s table because this is everyone\u0027s concern\u0022, shows in his ability to articulate what each of us could do to help and the different angles sexual abuse needs to be looked at. He is an avid speaker on this subject that each of us could learn from. Make sure to follow him as he faces every door on the roots of sexual abuse.

Emily Victoria gave up her friends, family, got rid of her TV, jewelry, wore dresses and headbands and sincerely wanted to join the PBCC and reunite with her boyfriend that wanted to marry her. Unfortunately, she was denied in every way and cut off of contact from the love of her life. Could it be that her boyfriend\u0027s family was looked down on or was it the sneering priests that thought she was a joke? Either way, the PBCC are showing the public they aren\u0027t holding to their agreements they laid out with the Charities Commision. Join Emily as she shares her meeting with the priests, screenshots of their messages and heartwrenching audio of her emotional pain after being denied what she wholeheartedly gave everything for. Can the Charity Comission hold the PBCC accountable for their misuse of their charity status? We certainly hope so!

In her year working there, she could not understand how awful this \u0022Christian\u0022 group was to humans. She met with Bruce Hales a few times and he referred to her as a whore to her face. Forced to wear long skirts and stockings, Floss describes the UBT workplace as a culture dominated by bullies that have little or no respect for women. Listen in as she details the alcohol abuse, homophobia, misogyny, hypocrisy and bullying she endured that took 2 months to even stand back up from. This podcast is absolutely full of shocking information-shared from an outsider, who was kind enough to share her experience in the hopes of educating others to avoid being exposed to this workplace environment.

We have long been aware of the extensive abuse of prescription drugs by the brethren\u2019s \u201Cin-house\u201D doctors to dope and medicate troublesome cult members \u2013 including the illegal and brutal attempt by Australian PBCC doctor, Mark Craddock at \u201Cconversion therapy\u201D in which he tried to chemically change a gay member in to a straight one, using the chemical castration drug, Cyprostat.  Could the brethren sink any lower?  Yes, they can and did. Get-a-Life hears the story of Todd Coulter, who was \u201Cprescribed\u201D Cyprostat for years, at his own expense, by Detroit brethren doctor Phil Truan. The doctor admitted that the drug was illegal in the USA, and arranged to have it shipped direct to Todd from the UK. After years of obediently taking the drug, Todd developed painful lumps in his breasts, requiring expensive surgery.  What was the justidication for this drastic and illegal medical intervention? Listen to this shocking episode to find that out \u2013 and much, much more.

We dive into the concerns and questions that every parent should have in any schooling system. Why would a school go through 6 principles in 5 years? What is Massimo Introvigne, a well known cult apologist and scholar of Satanism, doing at a Christian school that believes in keeping seperate from evil? Why would teachers find alcohol in water bottles in grade 7 \u0026 8 and changes not made? We have firsthand reports of disappeared fellow staff members being one of the most demoralizing thing about working for the PBCC school system. We hear of a kinder teacher candidate recgonizing and calling out signs of sexual abuse in little children with nothing being done about it. We also dive into how the Frank news reported on the latest accident in Australia.What would you expect a mainstream Christian Church, that separates itself from the evil of the world, to be like?

      "description": " Malcolm Rawlings and his young family were wrongly excommunicated in the 1970s. For 28 years, the family kept faith with Brethren doctrine, practicing separation and holding church meetings to the brethren calendar as a household. In Maple Creek, the brethren acknowledged their wrongdoing and the family, now with married children and with grandchildren, were readmitted to the fellowship in Maple Creek, Canada.The reward for this extraordinary but misguided faithfulness? The families were bullied, shredded, divided between different continents, and some members were excommunicated all over again.Fergus Howard, Malcolm\u2019s grandson was caught in this turmoil from a young age. As an \u201Coutsider\u201D in the Maple Creek congregation, he was subjected to horrific bullying. When his parents relocated to Worcester, UK, it got worse \u2013 much worse.This is just the prologue to over a decade of physical, psychological, and spiritual abuse that Fergus suffered at the hands of the PBCC. Finally Fergus discovered a message that Bruce Hales had sent to his priest:\u201CHe is thoroughly bad. Leave him to stew in his own juice\u201DRejected by his family, the brethren, and the so called \u201CMan of God\u201D, jobless, penniless and stranded in a cheap hotel in a foreign country, Fergus rebuilt his life, from nothing, step by step.The brethren claim to be prodigies of \u201Ccare and compassion in action\u201D. This harrowing account proves just how false and wilfully deceitful those words are.

At some point in the mid-1980s, Roy approached his father with one of Ken\u0027s sons present, with a proposal - a large parcel of farmland had come up for sale - if JHS would give him the money, Roy would buy the farm andf pass it on to Ken\u0027s children to give them a secure future.

      "description": " Nearly all members of the PBCC are born into the community and know no different \u2013 unless they leave. However, Dean Wheelers\u2019 parents left the PBCC and he was born outside of it. His father rejoined when Dean was 11 years old and gained custody of his three sons. Dean describes how alien it was to suddenly have to conform to PBCC rules and way of life after having a childhood of freedom. He recounts how doctrine enforced on him resulted in a religious trauma that took him years to work through and the difficulties he had in doing this. We hope you enjoy listening as Dean talks about this unusual perspective on the PBCC.

We merge 2 podcasts together to discuss the hierachy within the PBCC. Abi takes us through an in depth look at how this \u0022mainstream Christian church\u0022 runs as a business that seems to only benefit those at the top of this ecosystem. She walks us through a chart that was literally created by the PBCC and through emails that show their true colors. After watching this, it really does confirm, in black and white, where their priorities are. It definitely doesn\u0027t seem to be on the welfare of their congregation and teachings of the Bible. Where does this business seem to be heading as a \u0022Mainstream Christian Church?\u0022 Hopefully, those inside will see that money is the root of all evil and the freedom out here doesn\u0027t need that kind of wealth to be a heartfelt and compassionate Christian.

A sympathetic work colleague covered for him at work as she insisted that he went to see a Doctor.  As Murray shares what led up to that final breakdown and how this resulted in him leaving the brethren, we see yet another family divided by the brethren doctrine of separation. Murray describes how he tried to continue to see his children, and up to a point was successful in doing so \u2013 until recently.   Murray gives some excellent advice on how to protect your mental well being when leaving the PBCC by finding like minded friends as you navigate the transition into non PBCC life.

Stephen Gear had to do just that when he left the control of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC) in order to preserve his mental well-being. Many who have left this group will empathise with the deep sadness having to make that choice brings. Stephen shares how he found kindness outside the brethren when he needed it most. He describes how he tried to return to the brethren and was prevented from doing so by one person. Did that person have an ulterior motive for keeping Stephen from the family he loved?

The punishment: excommunication and shunning by her entire family, friends and everyone she had ever known. This is the incredible story of Lindy Jacomb \u2013 who having rebuilt her life from scratch after her devastating excommunication, set her heart on helping others so that no one will ever have to face that experience alone and afraid again.

One of 10 children raised by an authoritarian father and a mother driven to the depths of despair by mistreatment and bullying, Cassie was on the verge of marrying a young brother she barely knew, when she was struck by a conviction that she needed to leave the controlling sect and end the generational curse of spousal coercive control. One of the most riveting podcasts we have experienced, and an incredible story of how a single moment of enlightenment saved a young woman from degradation and made her the thriving success that she is today. Even though this is a 2 hour podcast, it\u0027s full of wise, sage advice from a woman who has seen and heard more than her share. Sit back, take it in small chunks and realize why Ben and Cassie are the perfect fit to open their arms to their Australian podcast.

He tells a story of bullying through his teenage years and the worthlessness he felt as he realised that he would never fit into the community he was born into. The manner which Fritz describes how gradually contact with his much loved family ceased will strike a chord with many others that have left. He talks candidly about how he has gained confidence as a person after leaving, and shares with us an incredible creative talent that would never have been nurtured within the brethren. This story is a testament to anyone that there is kindness and love in this world and the freedom to be yourself is liberating.

      "description": " Damian Hastie\u0027s investigations in to the PBCC have already been published in The Times - probably the most famous newspaper in the world. Here he gives a summary of the results to date of his comprehensive review of Brethren business and family wealth in the UK. Here on Get A Life we have repeatedly said that the brethren collect far, far more money than they could possibly spend on their schools - but we never had any hard numbers to back up this assertion - until now!  Damian gives us a mind blowing account of just how much money the wealthiest families in the brethren are making, and just how little of that wealth it would take to run the entire OneSchool system.  The burning question is - where does all the money go?  Listen in on conversations with ex-cult members. As we dissect the hidden lairs within these cults, we reveal the real trauma that goes on behind closed doors.   #plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #oneschoolglobal  ",

      "description": " TRIGGER WARNING This podcast contains discussions about suicide. Viewer discretion is advised  Join us as we explore with Ross Turner how it feels to be in the brethren and gay. Ross describes how he was told therapy sessions would \u2018make him straight\u2019 and how he had to deal with the feelings of worthlessness not only because he was gay but also because he had been born into a community who would never accept him the way he was. He recounts the effect this attitude had on his family and speaks with emotion over how he was not able to even say goodbye to his Mother. His story demonstrates the controlling methods employed by the brethren to try to make someone conform to their ways, and how that sent him into a mental spiral of addictions to try to cope with the pressure. Nine years later, Ross has overcome these additions and has found freedom in life with his partner. Ross finishes with a heartfelt message for anyone in the brethren who is gay.

Here is the much anticipated Part 2 of the podcast where Ben exposes how the Hales dynasty deleted a whole city off the map for the sake of a personal grievance, and then used a brethren spokesman to lie to the press about it. The perverted reasoning behind the eviction order, and the glib lies used to cover it up are so ultra-cultish it makes Scientology look like the Woman\u0027s Institute Knitting Circle.  Ben also drops his own insights in to who will be the Mog when the current Mog meets his maker.  You might get a surprise here!  listen in on conversations with ex-cult members.

Having blown the cult\u0027s appalling history of political, financial and sexual crime wide open in numerous newspaper articles and the famous book, \u0022Behind the Exclusive Brethren\u0022. He then added insult to injury by not being struck by lightning, dying of leprosy or succumbing to any other curses that the ever vengeful cult expected a wrathful God to smite him with.  In fact, as you will see, he looks remarkably cheerful.  Michael reveals some eye-popping details about the late Tony McCorkill that will have Bruce frothing with rage, scoops some particularly mephitic dirt on the late unlamented Dr. Kirkpatrick, and gives some titillating inside information on how he has pulled the wool over the brethren\u0027s eyes.  He\u0027s led them up the garden path and left them up the creek without a paddle.   #plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #oneschoolglobal  ",

      "description": "Listening to the Sydney Seminar recordings from our insiders brought to light how far away from Christianity the PBCC really have gotten. Their ruthless account for time and money is at the forefront in every aspect of their life. The \u0022Great Men\u0022 have replaced any bible teachings and the younger generations are being taught relentlessly to find a way to connect to these men. You will hear how apparent their heirarchy is and how much hypocrisy \u00A0there is when you read their lying rebuttals and comments they give to the media. We correct an imperative mistake in their math equation on how many of them are in the world. The Sydney Seminar was a revival of the system days which held all the same content on being a high acheiver and how to be accountable for every minute of your day to BDH. In their eyes, Men only need 6 hours of sleep, women need 7 and pigs need 8! Yes you read that right! Pigs need 8. This podcast reveals the true nature of why their business is doing so well. It is not a Christian Church....it is simply a business system. You will not find Christianity is any of their top leaders- but I can guarantee you, there are plenty of good Christian Churches out here that would leave you melting in your seat with love and compassion. \u00A0 Link to Care meeting transcript referred to in podcast- https://drive.google.com/file/d/17Iu50Jh5DYSXsAa0hA0_B8VTGeD9fRIC/view?usp=sharing\u00A0 Contact us at info.getalife@proton.me \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 #plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #oneschoolglobal",

      "description": "Join us in digging up a very pivitol part of the Exclusive Brethren/PBCC\u0027s past. Aberdeen is an unspoken time within the Brethren that has been locked up and the key thrown away. Bradley McCallum takes us on the VERY revealing journey of what led up to the Aberdeen incident and sheds light on many unanswered questions. David Shorto and Bradley confirm in detail how this was not a one time incident to draw out opposers but rather the fall out of an out of control leader. We challenge you to watch this and realize the hypocrisy of the lies that have been used to cover up such devastating truths. Did Aberdeen pave the way for continued abuse to be covered up and accepted? If Jt Jr had been held accountable, would the lives of victims all look different?\u00A0 \u00A0Aberdeen Incident file link- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1riImgAqwaqGwjYq6vRQIr4_jscJA0eQN/view?usp=share_link\u00A0 If we walk in the light letters link- https://drive.google.com/file/d/14WlgJladl1r95YGxW0FbZ0prYfjlg7FU/view?usp=share_link \u00A0 #plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #oneschoolglobal",

      "description": "Could you imagine waking up one morning and being told not to come to a church service and then finding out after someone had the power to play God with your life? Our guest Rob McLean lost his wife, 6 children, grandchildren and his business in a blink of an eye due to a priest that had it out for him. He was withdrawn from through the letterbox for asking a question about Aberdeen. \u00A0The real reason was due to Rob making a comment in regards to Bruce Hales and it was reported to him. \u00A0When Rob was in a larger community, he kept his head down and made the best of his life that he could. He had to transfer to a smaller community and that\u0027s when things went south. You will hear how dangerously horrific and evil this system is and how they take out Christ in every way and replace it with Bruce. Our hearts broke as Rob walked us through his recovery from alcohol from being in the brethren and how the medication Naltrexone changed his life. We dive into the situation well known to the ex brethren community when Braden Simmons had his house raided. Rob, living there at the time, shares the ferocious antics of the PBCC. After watching this podcast, you\u0027ll realize that somehow- we need to stop this bullying that destroys families! Noone should have the power to tear families apart. \u00A0 Contact us at info.getalife@proton.me \u00A0 #plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #Aberdeen #oneschoolglobal",

Numerous newspaper articles and TV programs have exposed the ugly mysogeny and homophobia that OneSchool Global has tried to hide from the Swedish public - taxpayers who are unwillingly funding this cult school - despite the fact that the PBCC businesses are extremely wealthy, and the brethren live in grand mansions in the most exclusive suburbs. \u00A0Tina has accomplished all this on her own - with only about 700 brethren in Sweden, the number of ex-members is also very small. We salute her courage and invite her to join our international team of truth-tellers!

Imagine the realization that a group that calls itself a church, so abusive and horrific that one must be partially drunk to sit through their meetings! Maple Creek, SK has been a PBCC group marked with hardline religious abuse, emotional abuse and has had constant huge losses of their young people. Could this be the key why? We hear Jen read a letter of her father\u0027s describing what he witnessed in his last 5 years of being in there, not ever being able to forget. Tracy recounts his parents being told that if he was dead- at least they would know where he is and Dennis informs us how Alan Drever had access to him. Our hearts break at the inaction of the past from the PBCC in Maple Creek and how they continue to turn a blind eye to the horrific abuse and generational trauma that happened. Together we bring Hope that this will change.\u00A0 \u00A0#plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #spiritualabuse #emotionalabuse #mentalabuse #generationaltrauma",

      "description": "OneSchool Global is the PBCC school system where 9000 students are educated according to the cult\u0027s \u0022ethos\u0022. Not a single one of those students will attend university. (Even the Taliban allows some university attendance - but not the PBCC) Shockingly, many of these schools in Canada and Australia are government funded. \u00A0Higher education is only one of Oneschool\u0027s problems. A culture of bullying is endemic to PBCC schools, and we release audio of a secretive cult broadcast called \u0022Strive 23\u0022 in which an anti-bullying program is proposed. We also look at Oneschool from the perspective of teachers, who often have terrible experiences. When we look at online reviews for Oneschool \u00A0on recruitment sites, the one observation that appears again and again is \u0022Colleagues simply disappear overnight\u0022. Sounds more like a horror movie than a school - but take a listen and judge for yourself!\u00A0 Transcript link- \u00A0https://tinyurl.com/Oneschoolbully\u00A0 Books referenced-\u00A0 On Having No Head - D.E Harding\u00A0 Waking Up - Sam Harris\u00A0 Cult Escape- John Spinks \u00A0 Article Links- \u00A0 https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2265258/Probe-strict-Christian-sect-school-shut-girl-pupil-37-days-making-Facebook-page.html https://tinyurl.com/nhw5j2uu https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/12/1131907 Banned book list https://drive.google.com/file/d/17BHYCt1eADnZMqkjpPtExnVz61kyoPBg/view?usp=sharing \u00A0\u00A0 Email info.getalife@proton.me for more info and to send your stories in. \u00A0\u00A0 *Strive 23 recording Copyright by PBCC/UBT/Bible and Gospel Trust #plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #OneSchoolGlobal #Bullies #Protecttheteachers #Strive23",

Ros show us that it is possible to break through the brainwashing of the PBCC when a spouse decides to leave or gets excommunicated. Join Ros as she recounts her attempts in leaving to rejoin her husband and how she finally got free. Listening to how she was labelled psychotic and had her children taken away is heart wrenching and shows how the gaslighting of the PBCC can make a mother question everything. Thankfully, Ros got some help from within the school and got free. Unfortunately, the person who helped her was suspended. We hear how much her child was bullied at the PBCC school and how free and happy her children are now. We hope this story really shows that ALL spouses can break free of the bondage the PBCC put on marriages when they want them to stay separated. \u00A0 Link to the news article that was written anonymously regarding Ros and her family-\u00A0 https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/mum-three-brainwashed-cult-who-17628561?utm_source=linkCopy\u0026utm_medium=social\u0026utm_campaign=sharebar\u00A0 #plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #gaslightingawareness",

We review from the beginning of the year how this Mainstream Christian Church is anything but MAINSTREAM. All links to the articles are listed on our Youtube channel so you can keep up with why we are fighting so hard for this to be exposed. In less than 2 hours, you will be astonished this group can even legally consider them a Christian Church and hold a charitable status. Richard even pulled out the JND Bible to show viewers how Stephen Harper\u0027s was actually a PBCC bible. He lets us in on the conversation that was had when he was inside regarding the gifting of this Bible to Stephen Harper.

Do they choose the word of Bruce over the teachings of the Bible? Do they believe they are the only ones with special light while labelling themselves a Mainstream Christian Church? If King Lemual was not supposed to drink because he\u0027s a King and leader, how is it that Bruce Hales feels comfortable drinking excessively as leader of the PBCC group? The Bible tells a husband to love his wife as Christ loves his assembly-does that condone a husband tossing his wife down the stairs? Did you know that in Bruce Hales\u0027 eyes, if you\u0027re not prosperous-God is not with you?? Join our discussion with special guest Peter Hart as we breakdown some of the fallacy taught to PBCC members.

She unpacks the myths of there being not much trauma in that generation and gives us a descriptive understanding of the power they used back then. She reveals her horror of why she asked to break bread. The importance of the PBCC history she shares, shows us how deep the implicit indoctrination affected that generation. Jill\u0027s journey into a psychology degree got her deep into the research of trauma that ex-members go through after leaving. She takes us though some of that research and we see through her very descriptive graphs the difference between the general population and an ex PBCC member. We get into a deep discussion on finding the right therapies and therapists. We are very curious as to what has worked for you and how did you get to a place of regulation after leaving? We are super excited to have Jill back on to discuss various therapies that have worked and what hasn\u0027t worked for ex-members.

He walks us through his struggles with mental health inside the PBCC and his visits to the brethren approved therapist Dr McPhillips who we find out took his own life. Braden explains the famous story of being told to drink cyanide or eat rat poison. Braden Simmons helps us dissect the RRT Charity set up by Bruce and his minions as a tax shelter and the salvation of the group\u2019s charity tax status. When you strip off the PBCC fa\u00E7ade and realize it\u2019s nothing more than another antic to keep money in Bruce\u2019s pockets you will share our disgust! We discuss the coercive control used on members in every aspect of their lives, the political deception hidden from many of the members and the new Strive 23 program the PBCC are launching in hopes of generating an extra 90 million dollars to line the already bursting church coffers. \u00A0#abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam",

Jim Clarkson described being ostracized, and isolated after priest\u2019s lips failed to keep knowledge and he was condemned for the feelings he had and life choices he was about to make. Jim took us through his life- the shock and sorrow of being called to his dying mother\u2019s bedside after 20\u002B years of separation, and yet the faith he has in an all loving, and forgiving God. It was a privilege to have Jim share his advice to any young person in a high control religious group- \u201Cseek out a support system.\u201D Don\u2019t settle in an unhappy life situation- surround yourself with people who care and seek to build you up. #plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch #pbcc #abuse #church #cult #religion #trauma #religioustrauma #sexualabuse #mindcontrol #brainwashing #conversation #exmembers #exposingtruth #whistleblower #getalifepodcast #getalife #podcast #exclusivebrethren #brucehales #johnhales #shutup #withdrawnfrom #worldly #excommunicate #assemblydeath #christiansect #christiancult #canadiancult #canadiansect #BruceHales #BDH #BruceDHales #UniversalBusinessTeam #UBT #RRT #RapidReliefTeam #RRTcares",

They eventually prescribe him a medication that is used for pedophiles. Craig gives us a firsthand account of a meal table experience sitting wedged between the PBCC leader Bruce D Hales and Tony McCorkell, a former PR manager for the church. Before the meal begins Craig counts 5 double Scotch Whiskeys consumed by Bruce and when the food arrives he switches to wine. When the meal is finished Bruce resumes drinking double scotches neat until time to leave to go to church for the evening service. Could it be the well-known leader of this cult also leads his flock in the vast consumption of alcohol that is so harmful to so many?

Her astute observation of the disgusting treatment of women- often treated as second class citizens, or as lesser humans is so spot-on with what so many of us who have left the PBCC have described. Christine was never a PBCC member so it is enlightening to hear her describe the abundant use of alcohol by very young children, the attitude of young PBCC men in the workplace and the huge pay discrimination between members \u0026 nonmembers. Not a shock to ex-members of this cult but a huge shock to those who have never had this first hand experience.

She takes us through what it was like to be a female within the church and how \u0022women were slaves\u0022. Her heart wrenching story on the day she left, brought us all to tears as we all knew of the pain she described. We dive into the leaders promise of the rapture and the lies covered up during a split in the 60\u0027s called Aberdeen. Could this have been the open door for abuse to be so widely accepted?
