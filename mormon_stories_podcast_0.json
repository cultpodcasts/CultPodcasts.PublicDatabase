Tara is the author of the book Educated. Born in Idaho to a father opposed to public education, she never attended school. She spent her days working in her father\u0027s junkyard or stewing herbs for her mother, a self-taught herbalist and midwife. She was seventeen the first time she set foot in a classroom. After that first encounter with education, she pursued learning for a decade, graduating magna cum laude from Brigham Young University in 2008 and subsequently winning a Gates Cambridge Scholarship. She earned an MPhil from Trinity College, Cambridge in 2009, and in 2010 was a visiting fellow at Harvard University. She returned to Cambridge, where she was awarded a PhD in history in 2014.",

During the 1980s and 1990s, Lowell Robison engaged in predatory sexual behaviors with several male cousins/BYU students. In 1995 Lowell Robison was called to serve as a mission president to the Mexico Leon mission (1995-1998). Christopher Swallow and his brother were two of his victims. When Christopher and his brother learned that Lowell Robison had been called as a mission president, they met with Elder Earl C. Tingey (LDS General Authority) at LDS church headquarters to report Lowell Robison\u0027s sexual abuse. Zero support was given to them as abuse victims, and no change was made to Lowell Robison\u0027s assignment, and he served out a full term as mission president.",

Gregory Prince takes an in-depth look at this respected historian and, in telling Arrington\u2019s story, gives readers insight into the workings of the LDS Church in the late twentieth century.\u00A0In 1972, during a major reorganization of the LDS Church, Arrington was asked to serve as the official church historian, thereby becoming the first\u2014and thus far the only\u2014professional historian to hold that title. He immediately set out to professionalize the entire Church History Division and open its extensive archives to scholarly researching. While the output of and from that division moved Mormon studies to a new level, the shift of historiography from faith promotion ecclesiastical, to scholarly and professional research and analysis was unacceptable to a handful of powerful senior apostles. In 1980 the History Division was disassembled and moved to Brigham Young University. That led to a shift in the professionalization of the Church History Division and Archives and in Arrington\u2019s career but not to a loss of his broad influence.\u0022 ________________________ Part 1:\u00A0Greg discusses why he chose to write this book and describes how Leonard Arrington became LDS Church Historian Part 2:\u00A0Greg discusses significant events that occurred during Leonard Arrington\u0027s administration Part 3:\u00A0Greg describes the legacy of Leonard Arrington and shares his thoughts on where the LDS Church presently stands in its presentation of church history ________________________",

No such opportunity is available to women. Through her own personal stories, those of her ancestors, and the thousands of stories that came to her through an Internet survey, Pearson shows the power of the Ghost of Eternal Polygamy as it not only waits on the other side to greet the most righteous in heaven, but also haunts the living\u2014hiding in the recesses of the Mormon psyche, inflicting profound pain and fear, assuring women that they are still objects, harming or destroying marriages, bringing chaos to family relationships, leading many to lose faith in the church and in God.\u0022",

Jaxon was introduced to issues of Mormon faith as his mother lost belief in and left the LDS church, while his father remained faithful to the church. Jaxon\u2019s involvement in an interfaith family led to strong personal interest in matters of faith, which has led to extensive interfaith efforts. In this interview Jaxon discusses his own history of doubts, including his experiencing watching the church evolve as an active Mormon youth in how it speaks about and teaches certain issues. He explains how he reconciles difficult Mormon issues and also discusses his view of classic and modern Mormon apologetics, including the newly coined term/wave of \u201Cneo-apologetics.\u201D",

Jaxon\u2019s involvement in an interfaith family led to strong personal interest in matters of faith, which has led to extensive interfaith efforts. In this interview Jaxon discusses his own history of doubts, including his experiencing watching the church evolve as an active Mormon youth in how it speaks about and teaches certain issues. He explains how he reconciles difficult Mormon issues and also discusses his view of classic and modern Mormon apologetics, including the newly coined term/wave of \u201Cneo-apologetics.\u201D",

Todd Christofferson\u2014Apostle in the LDS Church. \u00A0Sensing a void in his spiritual life, Tom began attending a local meetinghouse of the Church with the support of its leadership. Over time his relationship with his partner ended and his relationship with the Church began again. We ask Tom about his experience outlined in his book and delve deeper into the impacts his returning to the church had on his relationship with his partner, and on his spiritual self. \u00A0We also ask Tom tougher questions about whether his brother\u2019s apostleship affords him greater privilege as a member of the Mormon LGBTQ community, his thoughts on the November 2015 policy on children of same-sex parents denied baptism, and his being held up as a role model (intended or not) for Mormon LGBTQ youth to choose a life of celibacy in the LDS Church. We thank Tom for this fascinating interview and hope it furthers the conversation on reconciling sexuality with faith!",

We cover: *How his faith crisis developed on his LDS mission, but he finished his mission anyway *Dating while at BYU and how it distracted him from his faith crisis *How when a family member left the LDS Church, it forced him to confront his own doubts and begin an academic study of the truth claims of the Church *When he realized that the same problems with Mormon historicity were also at play with Christianity in general *He and his spouse\u2019s current belief state, and their desire to have a sense of community and solid religious framework for their children to hold onto *The main topics of his book, When Mormons Doubt, including a deep dive into sections on \u201CTruth,\u201D \u201CGoodness,\u201D and \u201CBeauty.\u201D",

Laurie Lee\u2019s story is fascinating on many levels:  Laurie Lee worked for 20 years as Chief Architect for the LDS Church and as Director of Design and/or Construction for around 40 LDS temples. She served as Stake President of the Tooele Utah Valley View Stake in Tooele, Utah for 8 years. While she remembers identifying internally as a woman from a very young age, she began to experience intense pressure to transition to female while serving as an LDS Stake President. This ultimately led to her being released as stake president after 8 years of service. About two months ago Laurie Lee was excommunicated stemming from her decision to transition gender presentation while living in her home ward/stake. Laurie Lee and her spouse have been married 32 years this month and are the parents of five children and 11 grandchildren. Laurie Lee remains a believer in many of the core tenets of Mormonism (e.g., Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, the atonement), and reads the Book of Mormon daily.",

We thank Sarah for sharing her powerful, beautiful story and know that it will touch lives!",

Derrick and John answer the difficult questions such as:  \u201CIs it disingenuous to stay active in the LDS Church with knowledge of \u2018problems\u2019 of historicity and knowing the harm the church inflicts on groups of people, like LGBTQ individuals?\u201D \u201CAre the people who remain complicit in that harm?\u201D \u201CShould the teachings of the church be taken literally or metaphorically?\u201D",

Todd Christofferson. \u00A0 \u00A0 Meg and Jake appeared on  episodes 508-510 of Mormon Stories discussing their experiences in early 2013 when their 13 year old son, Jon, came out to them as gay while they were living as committed, orthodox Mormons. \u00A0During this period Meg and Jake met Tom Christofferson, brother of Mormon Apostle D. Todd Christofferson. \u00A0At the time Meg and Jake met Tom he was an excommunicated gay Mormon man living in a committed relationship for over 18 years. \u00A0After hearing the Abhau\u2019s story, Tom graciously offered to arrange a meeting between them and his brother, Elder D. Todd Christofferson. \u00A0 In this episode Meg and Jake recount in detail their 1\u002B hour with apostle D. Todd Christofferson, which included: \u00A0  Elder D. Todd Christofferson acknowledging that the LDS Church may not be a safe place for our LGBT youth, Elder Christofferson acknowledging to Meg and Jake that personal revelation trumps revelation from Mormon leadership \u00A0(but that he would never be able to admit this publicly to church members), and Meg informing Elder Christofferson that he and other LDS leadership had/have \u201Cblood on their hands\u201D for the way that they have mishandled LGBT issues, contributing to a modern wave of LGBT youth suicides.   Meg and Jake also express their disappointment with Elder Christofferson\u2019s role in speaking as the representative for the LDS church during the November 2015 policy decision denouncing same-sex couples as apostates, and disallowing their children from being baptised into the Mormon church. \u00A0They also discuss their respective decisions to leave the Mormon church after decades of orthodox membership.",

      "description": "We are a group of women 40\u002B with longer life experiences. We are grandmothers, mothers, aunts, single, divorced, widowed or married. We are LGBT friendly and feminists! Many of us are just learning feminism. Having felt the pain of patriarchy, but not having a \u201Clanguage\u201D to describe our experiences, we are giving ourselves permission to flourish and grow with no limitations or constructs. Many of us are at the beginning of a life we never imagined. We have had to make tough decisions, been tried by our choices, and some of us have lost important connections along the way. Being of a \u201Ccertain age\u201D makes it harder to make friends and to find a community of like-minded souls with whom to move forward with love, joy and friendship. We realize that our decisions can affect many generations, so our time is spent fostering relationships with our loved ones and excelling in our careers, businesses, and at home, all of which leaves little time and opportunity to make new friends. This group is for \u201Cwomen of a certain age\u201D or lovingly called WOCA (Wah-kah). We also have a group for \u201Cwomen of a certain age\u201D and under. This age group, affectionally known as the UNDERS is from 30-40. The final group under the umbrella of WOCA are the COCAs. These are \u201CCouples of a Certain Age\u201D for those wishing to participate as couples. And housed inside of COCA is the \u201Cmen only\u201D group which meet regularly in men-only events. WOCA activities are NOT within the paradigm of our former religious background, although themes from our lived experiences may come up. We have transitioned from our former organized religious choices and wish to create wonderful spaces where ALL people with commonalities can come together, share and find community.

      "description": "Marco Meiling, active and believing LDS church member in the Netherlands, reports on the beginning of a major contraction of the LDS Church in Europe. From Marco\u0027s original message to me:  Have you heard yet about a big push to consolidate the units in Europe. We are having closing after closing being announced.\u00A0Yesterday a closing was announced, and the Stake President stated there are 800 units in Europe which are considered too weak and would need to merge. \u00A0We have 1163 units in Western Europe acc to\u00A0Cumorah.com. Holland with 34 wards will close 5 at least this year. \u00A0In Holland the Church is phasing out all wards which don\u00B4t have a purpose-built Chapel. Temple-attendance here is down 60% compared to 2000. \u00A0However the amount of recommendholders went up 200%. So what do we make of this: A Temple is a way for the Church to increase revenue. So even with less people, the Church can make a higher turnover.\u00A0 The main reason given is that these units are too weak to run programmes aimed at the youth. and small units demand too much from the few members. \u00A0Research has shown that people and families benefit form larger wards, and families are less burdened. That why the policy direction. Of course the longer travel will cause problems for some menbers. Assistance will be needed.",

      "description": "In this episode, an all-star panel reviews a recently leaked presentation created by the quorum of the twelve apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The presentation is entitled \u0022Area Business Weekends,\u0022 is dated December 8, 2015, and lays out\u00A0the process for local LDS stakes and areas to request special training meetings from the LDS quorum of the 12 (e.g., Boise Rescue, Elder Ballard\u0027s Young Single Adult stake in Utah County). Within the presentation the LDS Q12 reveals\u00A0its view on the external causes for\u00A0people leaving the LDS church, which explicitly\u00A0name individuals such as John Dehlin, Denver Snuffer, and Robert Norman, along with other broader trends, movements, and ideas such as secularism, Ordain Women, support for same-sex marriage (entitled \u0022Disagree with current policies\u0022), chastity, pornography, lack of commitment, failure to observe the sabbath, those fascinated with the \u0022last days/end of world\u0022 (i.e., Preppers/Julie Rowe), \u0022false prophets,\u0022 and anyone who feels they need \u0022something more\u0022 from the church.

      "description": "A bit of sad news, and a bit of happy news. \u00A0First the sad. Grant Palmer, author of\u00A0An Insider\u2019s View of Mormon Origins\u00A0\u2013 certainly one of the most important books in 20th/21st century Mormonism, is dying of cancer. \u00A0I confirmed this with Grant yesterday \u2013 when he related to me that he likely only has weeks/months to live. \u00A0This information moves many of us deeply, since Grant\u2019s courageous scholarship\u00A0over the years (which has come at a great personal cost to him) has been instrumental in helping tens of thousands of Mormons understand their church history more accurately. \u00A0I dare say that projects\u00A0like Mormon Stories Podcast,\u00A0Mormon Think,\u00A0Letter to a CES Director, and even the recent\u00A0LDS Church Gospel Topics Essays\u00A0would not exist without the courage and scholarship\u00A0of Grant Palmer. Now for the happy news. \u00A0Mormon Stories Podcast and the Open Stories Foundation, along with a few supporters,\u00A0will be holding a private event in Grant Palmer\u2019s honor on the evening of February 15, 2017* in Utah\u00A0\u2013 with the plan of live-streaming the event to all who are interested in showing support for Grant. \u00A0The event will include:  An interview with Grant, wherein he will discuss his most recent book, along with reflections on his life. A chance for some of those who are grateful for Grant\u2019s work to express appreciation for him.  If you are interested in participating in this tribute/celebration, there are a few things you can do to participate:  Record a brief Facebook or Youtube video expressing your gratitude to Grant (and his positive impact on your life), and post the link as a comment here. Write a text-based tribute to Grant in the comments section here. Send an email to\u00A0mormonstories@gmail.com\u00A0with \u201CGrant Pamer\u201D in the subject line, wherein you express to Grant your gratitude for the positive impact that his work has had on your life.  Feel free to use the hash tag #grantpalmer for any of the tributes you share on social media. \u00A0Finally, these emails, blog comments, and videos will be gathered and shared with Grant at the live-steamed, worldwide event in honor of him. Thanks for taking the time to honor Grant with us, and we very much look forward to the evening of February 15th* wherein we hope to\u00A0show Grant how much we love and appreciate him! \u00A0*Date subject to how Grant is doing/feeling.",

Part 2: Margi\u0027s faith crisis and transition away from Mormon orthodoxy, including our time trying to remain LDS as semi-believers, and her experiences and reflections on my excommunication. \u00A0Topics include the impetus for Margi\u0027s faith transition, how she/we \u0022came out\u0022 to our children parents, extended family, etc.\u00A0as unorthodox Mormons, and what the most difficult and rewarding parts of the transition were. Part 3: Margi\u0027s life and perspective now, as a post-Mormon, including reflections on her current beliefs and non-beliefs, her approach to nurturing a healthy/happy family without religion, how she approaches raising children without the church, and why she feels as though she and our family are happier and healthier than ever before after leaving the church.  The plan for Mormon Transitions podcast is\u00A0as follows:  We plan to conduct somewhere between 20 and 30 of these interviews, and to share them at http://mormontransitions.org. \u00A0We also plan to \u0022chop\u0022 these interviews up by question, so that people can peruse the interview by topic (e.g., raising children after a faith crisis, how to \u0022come out\u0022 to family and friends, secular spirituality, dealing with death). We plan to host a weekly call-in show where people can call with their questions/concerns and receive feedback from a mental health professional and/or expert. We plan to compile all the advice and perspective over 2017 into a book entitled something to the effect of, \u0022Navigating a Mormon Transition.\u0022 We plan to continue hosting Mormon Transition Events across the U.S. \u00A0See our\u00A0Mormon Transitions event calendar\u00A0for events as they are scheduled.

      "description": "On a recent trip from New Jersey to Vermont with Mormon Therapist Natasha Helfer Parker and Dr. Gina Colvin we decided to have a rough, unplanned, unrehearsed, and VERY\u00A0informal first discussion about post-Mormon polyamory and non-monogamy. \u00A0 For those who care deeply about this issue, there are a few very important things we would like to emphasize:  This is a rough, free-form, first discussion about orthodox, transitioning, and post-Mormon non-monogamy and polyamory. \u00A0This is not meant to be a pre-planned, comprehensive, uber-professional treatment of the topic. \u00A0If you are looking for such a treatment, please do not listen. For those of you who are very knowledgable about and/or experienced with polyamory and non-monogamy,\u00A0we openly acknowledge that we likely (or most definitely)\u00A0employed\u00A0several incorrect or improper terms, stereotypes, and biases in this discussion. We do this partially on purpose - because it gives us/you a chance to explore and correct common mistakes or misperceptions used regarding these sensitive and important topics. \u00A0 For those of you who are interested in this topic, or who were frustrated in any way by this first treatment/discussion -\u00A0we hope that you will give us your thoughts, perspective, and respectful criticisms in the blog comments. \u00A0Then, please know what we 100% plan to have at least a few future guests on Mormon Stories Podcast to explore this topic more in-depth, and in more serious ways. \u00A0If you have participated in polyamory and/or non-monogamy as an active, transitioning, or post-Mormon, we invite you to contact us about appearing in a future episode. \u00A0mormonstories@gmail.com  Thanks for your patience, understanding, support, participation, and good\u00A0will as we begin to explore this important topic that affects many people in orthodox, transitioning, and post-Mormonism.",

They have served in high-level callings in their Anchorage ward, and are very well-respected and well-liked in their Alaska LDS community. Two years ago Amy and Jake began to have doubts about the truthfulness of the LDS Church. As they began to share their questions/doubts/concerns about LDS doctrine and policy on Facebook (e.g., the November 2015 policy against LGBT Mormons and their children), their posts were monitored by ward and stake members and reported to the stake leadership. When they were directly asked by their stake president to remain silent about their questions/concerns/doubts/disbelief \u2013 they declined as a matter of conscience. Recently when they spoke out publicly on Facebook against the November, 2015 LGBT policy (out of concern for LDS LGBT youth suicides) they were informed by their LDS stake president that they will soon be excommunicated. The date/time of their disciplinary council is October 11, 2016 at 9pm Utah time. This is their story. P.S. \u00A0Amy is a fabulous artist. \u00A0Her artwork\u00A0can be found here! \u00A0www.amymalouf.com",

      "description": "Dr. Omar Kader was born in Provo, Utah to Palestinian immigrants. HIs father was a devout Muslim and a disabled World War I vet who owned a successful Provo fruit farm. During Omar\u0027s childhood he and his family were called the n-word by fellow Provoans, but fought to earn the respect of his community. Omar and his father were close friends of Dr. Hugh Nibley, who liked to practice his Arabic skills with Omar\u0027s dad. In this epic multi-part series, we hear several inspiring stories, including:  How Omar escaped Palestine after being sent back there by his father to prevent him from marrying a Utah woman. How Dr. Hugh Nibley fought to help Omar enroll in Brigham Young University. How Omar met, courted, and married his amazing wife Nancy - a brilliant Mormon girl from Ogden, UT (this courtship included his conversion to the LDS faith). We also touch on what it was like to enter into a multi-cultural marriage in Utah during the 1960s. Omar\u0027s draft into the Vietnam War (serving in Germany) How Omar and Nancy risked expulsion from BYU for fighting against the Vietnam war and for supporting the BYU Student Democratic Party during the Earnest L. Wilkinson administration -- and how Hugh Nibley came to their rescue. Omar\u0027s experiences obtaining a Ph.D. in International Relations at USC, along with his 10 year career at BYU wherein he faced both considerable racism and heroic support from certain BYU faculty and administrators. Nancy\u0027s work with the Democratic party in Utah, which included interactions with actor Robert Redford. Omar\u0027s decision to leave BYU and move to Washington D.C. Omar\u0027s work as a lobbyist for Arab-Americans, which included meetings with Yasser Arafat and King Hussein of Jordan. The part Omar played in helping BYU obtain the land to build the BYU Jerusalem center, which he later grew to regret. Omar\u0027s scorching critiques of LDS apostles Ezra Taft Benson and Jeffrey R. Holland. Omar\u0027s work as a successful businessman in Washington D.C. against all odds as an Arab-American. Nancy\u0027s trial of faith after befriending Kate Kelly in her Virginia ward, and then watching her friend get excommunicated. Where Omar and Nancy now stand with the LDS church, and with matters of faith.",

After stumbling on the LDS Gospel Topics Essays and learning about Joseph Smith\u0027s polyandry, the Book of Abraham translation problems, etc. -- and specifically after the LDS Church November 2015 policy change regarding LGBT members and their children -- Sam experienced an LDS faith crisis. Over time, Sam developed his own method for expressing concern about LDS policy and administrative problems -- he decided to begin living the Law of Common Consent as found in Doctrine and Covenants 26, which to him means that during every ward, stake and general conference Sam will be voting opposed when asked to sustain the LDS first presidency and the quorum of the 12 apostles. Sam is also inviting other LDS church members to consider a similar approach if they object to recent policy and administrative changes. This interview includes Jamie Hanis Handy and Sam\u0027s 85 year old mother, Bertie, who recently resigned her church membership over similar concerns to Sam.",

After consulting with his LDS bishop, he was told that his \u201Csame-sex attraction\u201D would \u201Cresolve itself\u201D once he served an LDS mission. His LDS patriarchal blessing also assured him that he would serve a complete LDS mission. After being called to the Leeds, England mission, Mike was physically and emotionally abused by his first companion. Suffering with severe PTSD symptoms, he tried for two months to remain in the mission, but did not receive appropriate mental health care. Instead, his mission-assigned therapist focused primarily on encouraging Mike to read his scriptures and pray more, which only reinforced his feelings of shame/blame as an abuse victim. In addition, Mike\u2019s abusive companion was never punished for the abuse (to his knowledge), and was simply reassigned to other missionaries. Mike ended up returning home early from his mission (after 3 months of service), and spent several years trying to reconcile the shame/guilt that he felt, heal from his PTSD, and reconcile his same-sex sexuality. Mike consulted\u00A0North Star LDS\u00A0to help him manage his sexuality and remain faithful LDS, but this approach ultimately led him to a suicide attempt. Mike ultimately found peace and mental health by leaving the LDS church, and coming out as a gay man.",

Towards the latter half of her mission she began to experience depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation,\u00A0due in part to a culture of perfectionism within Mormonism, along with doubts she began to experience as a missionary (primarily around LGBT and historical issues). When she informed her mission president of her depressive symptoms, he allowed her only three visits to a talk therapist. Over time on her mission, she began to experience significant suicidal ideation, and on the final\u00A0month of her mission was self-admitted to a psychiatric behavioral health unit/hospital. \u00A0After her stay in the hospital, she decided that she no longer believed the church to be\u00A0true, and terminated her mission service early (a few weeks shy of completion). While the LDS church attempted to make her parents pay her hospital bills while a missionary, her parents declined and threatened to sue the church if they continued with such insistences. Eventually she decided to leave the LDS church, and has experienced significant improvement in her mental health, and elimination of her suicidality, as a result of this decision. \u00A0At present, she is engaged to be married and works as a nurse at Planned Parenthood in California.",

      "description": "When Race, Religion, and Sport Collide tells the story of Brandon Davies\u2019 dismissal from Brigham Young University\u2019s NCAA playoff basketball team to illustrate the thorny intersection of religion, race, and sport at BYU and beyond. Author Darron T. Smith analyzes the athletes dismissed through BYU\u2019s honor code violations and suggests that they are disproportionately African American, which has troubling implications. He ties these dismissals to the complicated history of negative views towards African Americans in the LDS faith. These honor code dismissals elucidate the challenges facing black athletes at predominantly white institutions. Weaving together the history of the black athlete in America and the experience of blackness in Mormon theology, When Race, Religion, and Sport Collide offers a timely and powerful analysis of the challenges facing African American athletes in the NCAA today. Dr. Darron T.

A description of the book follows:  When Alex Cooper was fifteen years old, life was pretty ordinary in her sleepy suburban town and nice Mormon family. At church and at home, Alex was taught that God had a plan for everyone. But something was gnawing at her that made her feel different. These feelings exploded when she met Yvette, a girl who made Alex feel alive in a new way, and with whom Alex would quickly fall in love. Alex knew she was holding a secret that could shatter her family, her church community, and her life. Yet when this secret couldn\u2019t be hidden any longer, she told her parents that she was gay, and the nightmare began. She was driven from her home in Southern California to Utah, where, against her will, her parents handed her over to fellow Mormons who promised to save Alex from her homosexuality. For eight harrowing months, Alex was held captive in an unlicensed \u201Cresidential treatment program\u201D modeled on the many \u201Ctherapeutic\u201D boot camps scattered across Utah. Alex was physically and verbally abused, and many days she was forced to stand facing a wall wearing a heavy backpack full of rocks. Her captors used faith to punish and terrorize her. With the help of a dedicated legal team in Salt Lake City, Alex eventually escaped and made legal history in Utah by winning the right to live under the law\u2019s protection as an openly gay teenager.

Oaks, Apostles for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Title:\u00A0The Free Exercise of Religion in Our Time Date: February 9 2016 Location: Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies Description: Freedom of religion is a fundamental human right. Yet in many seen and unseen ways its validity is challenged at the margins every day. Elder Dallin H. Oaks, member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, will speak about the importance of maintaining and protecting religious liberty in the international sphere. After his remarks he will field questions in an audience Q\u0026A. Source: This presentation was recorded by Andrew Evans in accordance with District of Columbia law. Note: As the final question of the evening, Andrew Evans asked Elder Oaks the following question: Andrew\u0027s Question: \u0022Less than a year ago, right here in Washington, DC, my friend killed himself. He was Mormon and gay. You\u0027ve gone on record that, \u0027the Church does not give apologies\u0027. Does religious freedom absolve you from responsibility in the gay Mormon suicide crisis?\u0022 \u00A0 Elder Oaks\u0027 Response: \u0022I think that\u0027s a question that will be answered on judgment day. I can\u0027t answer that beyond what has already been said. I know that those tragic events happen. And it\u0027s not unique simply to the question of sexual preference. There are other cases where people have taken their own lives and blamed a church--my church--or a government, or somebody else for their taking their own lives, and I think those things have to be judged by a higher authority than exists on this earth, and I am ready to be accountable to that authority, but I think part of what my responsibility extends to, is trying to teach people to be loving, and civil and sensitive to one another so that people will not feel driven, whatever the policy disagreements, whatever the rules of the church, or the practices of a church, or any other organization, if they are administered with kindness, at the highest level or at the level of the congregation or the ward, they won\u0027t drive people to take those extreme measures; that\u0027s part of my responsibility to teach that. And beyond that, I will be accountable to higher authority for that. That\u0027s the way I look on that. Nobody is sadder about a case like that than I am. Maybe that\u0027s a good note to end on.\u0022",

      "description": "Speaker: Elder Dallin H. Oaks, Apostles for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Title:\u00A0The Free Exercise of Religion in Our Time Date: February 9 2016 Location: Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies Description: Freedom of religion is a fundamental human right. Yet in many seen and unseen ways its validity is challenged at the margins every day. Elder Dallin H. Oaks, member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, will speak about the importance of maintaining and protecting religious liberty in the international sphere. After his remarks he will field questions in an audience Q\u0026A. Source: This presentation was recorded by Andrew Evans in accordance with District of Columbia law. Note: As the final question of the evening, Andrew Evans asked Elder Oaks the following question: Andrew\u0027s Question: \u0022Less than a year ago, right here in Washington, DC, my friend killed himself. He was Mormon and gay. You\u0027ve gone on record that, \u0027the Church does not give apologies\u0027. Does religious freedom absolve you from responsibility in the gay Mormon suicide crisis?\u0022 \u00A0 Elder Oaks\u0027 Response: \u0022I think that\u0027s a question that will be answered on judgment day. I can\u0027t answer that beyond what has already been said. I know that those tragic events happen. And it\u0027s not unique simply to the question of sexual preference. There are other cases where people have taken their own lives and blamed a church--my church--or a government, or somebody else for their taking their own lives, and I think those things have to be judged by a higher authority than exists on this earth, and I am ready to be accountable to that authority, but I think part of what my responsibility extends to, is trying to teach people to be loving, and civil and sensitive to one another so that people will not feel driven, whatever the policy disagreements, whatever the rules of the church, or the practices of a church, or any other organization, if they are administered with kindness, at the highest level or at the level of the congregation or the ward, they won\u0027t drive people to take those extreme measures; that\u0027s part of my responsibility to teach that. And beyond that, I will be accountable to higher authority for that. That\u0027s the way I look on that. Nobody is sadder about a case like that than I am. Maybe that\u0027s a good note to end on.\u0022",

Mormons in a same-sex marriage will now be considered apostates and could be subject to disciplinary hearings and excommunication. Their children, meanwhile, will be barred from many of the faith\u2019s sacred rituals, unless they get permission from church\u2019s highest leaders. Monday, a panel of guests joined us to discuss the impacts and ramifications of these new church policies. GUESTS  Jennifer Dobner\u00A0is a journalist at the Salt Lake Tribune where she covers health care reform, Mormonism, polygamy, justice issues and more. John Dehlin has a Ph.D.\u00A0in psychology from Utah State University, focusing on religion, mental health, and the LGBT\u00A0Mormon experience. he co-led the largest study ever conducted on LGBT\u00A0Mormons that has been published in numerous scientific, peer reviewed journals, including the APA\u0027s\u00A0Journal of Counseling Psychology. He also produces and hosts the\u00A0Mormon Stories podcast.\u00A0He was excommunicated from the LDS Church in January of 2015. He was credited in several news reports for leaking information about the Church\u2019s new policy on married same-sex Mormons and their children. Kendall Wilcox is an openly gay and active Mormon. He\u2019s a co-founder of\u00A0Mormons Building Bridges, a group that works to build understanding between members of the LDS Church and the LGBT community.

      "description": "In this episode sociologist and scholar Mark Juergensmeyer, Ph.D. explains his reasons for boycotting Brigham Y0ung University over its policy to expell LDS students who lose their testimony of the LDS Church\u0027s truthfulness.  \u00A0   \u00A0   \u00A0  The text of Dr. Juergensmeyer\u0027s letter is as follows:  Prof Elizabeth ClarkAssociate DirectorInternational Center for Law and Religion StudiesBrigham Young University Dear Elizabeth: I regret that I will be unable to participate in the Law and Religion Symposium that is being held this week at BYU. It was an honor to be invited to speak at this event, and as you know I made every effort to make room in my schedule to be there on Tuesday. My decision not to participate is an act of conscience based on BYU\u2019s policy of expelling any Mormon student who leaves the faith or converts to another religion. Alas I was unaware of this policy until this weekend when it was brought to my attention. I have decided that it would be hypocritical of me to participate in a conference in which the issue of religious liberty is paramount when the institution sponsoring it fundamentally violates this principle in its policies towards Mormon students. As I understand it, non-Mormons are allowed to enroll in BYU, and they are welcome to convert to the Mormon faith if they wish, but if \u00A0Mormon students change their religious affiliation they lose their scholarship, their campus housing and jobs, and are expelled from school even if they are months away from graduation. In making this decision I mean no disrespect to you, the Center with which you are affiliated, or the other participants in this week\u2019s conference. I know that many faculty members at BYU are opposed to this policy and are quietly working to change it. I applaud them, and hope that my decision will be taken as a sign of support for those within BYU who are seeking change. I appreciation your dilemma and admire your persistence. Again, thanks for the honor of the invitation. I hope that I will be invited back to BYU and will be able to accept some time in the future when this policy restricting religious freedom is lifted. Sincerely, Mark JuergensmeyerProfessor of Sociology and Global StudiesFounding Director and FellowOrfalea Center for Global and International Studies  A HUGE thanks to the amazing work of\u00A0FreeBYU.org for breaking this important story. Dr. Juergensmeyer is\u00A0director of the Orfalea Center for Global and International Studies, professor of sociology and global studies, and affiliate professor of religious studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He is a pioneer in the field of global studies and writes on global religion, religious violence, conflict resolution and South Asian religion and politics. He has published more than three hundred articles and twenty books, including the recent Global Rebellion: Religious Challenges to the Secular State (University of California Press, 2008).

In this episode, Dave\u00A0begins by discussing his LDS pioneer ancestry, and his early years in the LDS church as a faithful, science-loving boy from St. George. \u00A0He then discusses early doubts he began to have regarding his LDS faith as he explored the field of epistemology (the study of how we know things). \u00A0In spite of these doubts, Dave chose to serve an LDS mission in the Australia Sydney Mission (1979 to 1981 timeframe), and during this time struggled with the pressure tactics\u00A0employed by his mission president (Orson Wright). \u00A0Ultimately, to Dave\u0027s surprise, Orson Wright was removed from the mission for propositioning the sister missionaries of the mission to be his polygamous wives -- and\u00A0the reasons for President Wright\u0027s removal from the mission were covered up by LDS Church leadership including Thomas S. Monson and Joseph B. Wirthlin. This episode provides a fascinating look into the issues\u00A0of: 1) how we come to feel as though we \u0022know\u0022 things, and 2) how LDS church members (and members of other religious faiths) can be manipulated into claiming religious knowledge through emotional means. \u00A0 Dr. Christian is available to provide psychotherapy in Utah, and Skype-based coaching outside of Utah.

      "description": "For decades, and\u00A0heavily\u00A0over\u00A0the past ten years, Mormon historians, podcasters, and critics have been urging\u00A0the LDS Church to be more open and honest about Joseph Smith\u0027s use of folk magic and a peep stone/hat in his\u00A0production\u00A0of the Book of Mormon text. On August 4th, 2015 the LDS Church released the third volume of the Joseph Smith Papers, which includes the printer\u0027s manuscript of the Book of Mormon. It also released photos of the seer stone that Joseph Smith used as a\u00A0scryer\u00A0to search for buried treasure, and that he also placed in a hat to produce the text for the Book of Mormon. \u00A0(for detailed\u00A0discussions of Joseph\u0027s use of a seer stone in the Book of Mormon\u0027s creation, see\u00A0CES Letter,\u00A0Mormon Think, or D. Michael Quinn\u0027s \u0022Early Mormonism and the Magic World View.\u0022 An October 2015 Ensign article is set to\u00A0appear called \u0022Joseph the Seer\u0022 which attempts to explain Joseph\u0027s practice of using a seer stone. In this episode John Hamer, J. Seawright, Micah Nickolaisen, Jamie Hanis Handy, and Jonathan Streeter join us to analyze these events.",

Holland. His experience receiving a secret/sacred LDS church ordinance called the \u0022Second Anointing,\u0022 wherein he was anointed by the hands of Elder M.

She was deeply committed to the church as a teen, but she also excelled in school and dreamed of obtaining a Ph.D. in Genetics. After receiving the prestigious Gordon B. Hinckley scholarship at BYU, she married Carson Calderwood after her freshman year. Although she remained devoutly LDS for well over decade, Marisa struggled with feeling like she lost herself and her dreams once she married Carson, especially after going through the LDS temple and receiving the impression that women were less than men in the LDS church. Over the next several years Marisa had four children with Carson, but she also began having chronic headaches, and sinking deeper and deeper into depression. Finally, once Marisa began to allow herself to consider the possibility that the LDS church might not be true, she began feeling better about herself, her headaches subsided, and she and Carson found a happiness and an authenticity in their marriage that they never knew before. Today Marisa and her husband Carson are being threatened with excommunication for speaking openly about their doubts and disbelief. They expect to receive their summons to a disciplinary council within the coming week. This is Marisa\u0027s story.",

In contrast with the types of challenges presented to people by \u201Coutsiders\u201D to their faith, a change in stance and the new worldview presented by those who were once in sync with you (or at least perceived to be in sync) can be far more devastating. Their shifts often feel very personal, a rejection of something we hold most dear. And they have no excuse! They once knew what we know and now challenge and say they are seeing more clearly or experiencing something else more richly? For those who are the ones who have shifted, a loved one\u2019s negative reactions to that person\u2019s change also can feel quite personal. Why don\u2019t they trust me that I\u2019m on a good path, that I have information or insights that open the world to me in new ways? Why are they choosing stubbornness and clinging to ideology and dogma over really exploring and staying in close relationship with me no matter where my faith journey takes me? How can we see these and other dynamics more clearly? What is \u201Cour\u201D responsibility as those who have been the one whose perspectives have shifted? How can both parties better understand the challenges of this situation and learn to have compassion for each other? What are key virtues needed in such relationships? What are some \u201Cdos\u201D and \u201Cdon\u2019ts\u201D for negotiating this difficult interpersonal terrain? Please listen and then share your stories and insights in the comments section below!",

      "description": "Skip to Main ContentSearch This Site:  Main Navigati2014 McMurrin Lecture on Religion and Culture with Kathleen Flake \u0022The LDS Intellectual Tradition: A Study on Three Lives\u0022April 11, 2014 Symposium: \u0022Faith and Reason, Conscience and Conflict:\u00A0The Paths of Lowell Bennion, Sterling McMurrin, and Obert Tanner\u0022April 12, 2014\u00A0     McMurrin Lecture:\u00A0In her lecture, Flake defines an intellectual as one who loves and is committed to the life of the mind, one for whom thought is both a delight and a necessity, a source as well as means for human flourishing. This does not mean a life without conflicts, as illustrated by three intellectuals - Lowell Bennion, Sterling McMurrin, and Obert Tanner. Flake will consider their intellectual lives in relation to the religious culture from which they came. Doing so will tell us something about whether there is a Mormon intellectual tradition and, if so, what are its distinctive features. Kathleen Flake holds the Richard L. Bushman Chair of Mormon Studies at the University of Virginia. She is the author of\u00A0The Politics of American Religious Identity: The Seating of Senator Reed Smoot, Mormon Apostle\u00A0(University of North Carolina Press, 2004). Professor Flake has been awarded grants from the Mellon Foundation, Lily Endowment, Pew Charitable Trusts, and American Philosophical Society.\u00A0 She has held office in the American Academy of Religion, the American Society of Church History, and the Southeastern Commission for the Study of Religion. Frequently invited to comment on Mormonism in the news, she is also a panelist for the Washington Post/Newsweek \u0022On Faith\u0022 blog. \u00A0  Symposium:\u00A0Mormonism is often seen as a religion of conformity, with a hierarchy in tight control of members\u2019 beliefs and behavior. Yet this perspective misses a rich tradition of intellectual independence and principled dissent. With an eye to the present and future, the Tanner Humanities Center will offer a unique symposium on the lives and legacies of Sterling M. McMurrin, Obert C. Tanner, and Lowell L. Bennion. Their stories reveal the tensions between faith and reason, conformity and dissent.\u00A0This symposium will mark the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Obert C. and Grace A. Tanner Humanities Center. Panels include \u201CChallenge of Conscience: Sterling M. McMurrin\u201D (9:00-10:30 AM), with Bob Goldberg (Chair), Jack Newell, James Clayton, and Brian Birch; \u201CChallenge of Loyalty: Lowell Bennion\u201D (11:00 AM-12:30 PM), with Irene Fisher (Chair), Greg Prince, Tony Morgan, Sam Allen, and Emma Lou Thayne; and \u201CChallenge of Faith: Obert C. Tanner\u201D (1:30-3:00 PM), with Greg Thompson (Chair), Kent Murdock, Bob Goldberg, and Grethe Peterson. A concluding panel, titled \u201CPublic Men and the Challenge of Their Private Worlds\u201D (3:30-5:00 PM), will focus upon the personal, intellectual, and working relationships that existed among these men, with panelists Linda King Newell (Chair), Carolyn Tanner Irish, Ellen Bennion Stone, Charlotte Hansen Terry, and Bill McMurrin. \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 These three intellectuals who shared a determination to act were rooted in Mormonism, but possessed distinctive visions that penetrated beyond their treasured religious heritage and drove them to embrace\u2014and respond to\u2014the pressing social, cultural, and political issues of their time.\u00A0 With mutual respect, but using distinctive methods, Tanner, McMurrin and Bennion shared a passion for justice and impatience with racial discrimination in their church and across American society. \u00A0At various points in their careers, they served the LDS Church, the University of Utah, their state, and the nation in pursuit of their visions of a more enlightened and humane society. Pursuing justice and adhering to conscience brought its own rewards, but also exacted a cost. As Director of the University of Utah\u2019s LDS Institute of Religion, Lowell Bennion chafed at supporting church authorities in their denial of the priesthood to African American men. \u00A0Largely over this issue, he surrendered\u00A0this post, swallowed his disappointment, and vigorously channeled his religious instincts into serving the needy in Salt Lake City.\u00A0 Sterling McMurrin chose to proclaim himself a heretic and relished that identity, but lost friendships and some sense of community. Obert Tanner, a closet skeptic, muffled his doubt and kept his silence to play prominent roles in the life of his country, state, and city. Symposium speakers and panelists will not only examine the specific, contemporary impacts of Lowell Bennion, Sterling McMurrin, and O.C. Tanner, but also consider their enduring legacies on the issues facing the Mormon Church today: the inclusion of women more fully in church leadership circles, the need to face painful facets of church history more honestly, the challenge of retaining the engagement or affiliation of socially and culturally liberal members and young adults, the quest to understand the effects of new technologies on Mormon practices and beliefs, and other concerns of our time. A concluding panel will focus upon the personal, intellectual, and working relationships that existed among these men.\u00A0 The Tanner Center is partnering with the College of Humanities, Smith-Pettit Foundation, and Michael Morris to bring you this event.",

It creates, they argue, an impossible situation where students are seemingly forced to choose between their integrity and the education they have worked and payed for. In this episode, we\u0027re joined by several members of Free BYU, an organization dedicated to raising awareness of what they consider a lack of religious freedom within the Church Educational System. We discuss with Free BYU leaders the Honor Code as it relates to religious freedom, ecclesiastical endorsements and how to handle a faith transition while at a church school. We\u0027ll also talk with two current students as they talk about how they are trying to navigate their faith transitions while attending BYU.",

      "description": "In this episode of Mormon Stories, J. Nelson-Seawright interviews David Campbell, Professor of Political Science at the University of Notre Dame and the founding director of the Rooney Center for the Study of American Democracy, about his celebrated research on religion and politics in America. Professor Campbell argues that the current partisan environment, in which religious people mostly support the Republican Party and less religious people the Democratic Party, is a recent development --- and he explains how this pattern can help explain America\u0027s recent rise in irreligiosity.Campbell also discusses his work on Mormonism and politics. He explains his research about how Mormon identity is different in American context: stronger, more collective, more integrated, and with stricter boundaries. He discusses implications for how Mormonism interacts with politics, and also for the identity and religious options of liberal and disaffected Mormons.",

Jerald is the great-great-grandson of John Tanner, well known for his sizable financial contributions to Joseph Smith and the LDS church in 1835 when the church was deeply in debt. Sandra Tanner is a great-great-granddaughter of Brigham Young, the second president of the Mormon Church.  As teenagers, before they met, Jerald and Sandra were challenged by different people and events to examine the origins of Mormonism. Soon after their introduction, they jointly began researching Mormonism and became engaged. Both accepted Christ during these early years of study and have left the Mormon church. They are both active members of a local Christian church in Salt Lake City.  This episode explores Sandra and Jerald\u2019s early years before forming Utah Lighthouse Ministries.",

      "description": "The Indian Placement Program was a program of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from 1947 to 2000, in which LDS Native American students were placed in LDS foster homes during the school year, where they would attend public schools and become assimilated into American culture. The program was initially developed to respond to the needs of Navajo teenagers and even younger children who were coming to parts of Utah to work. It was felt it would be better for them to get an education. Beginning in the 1970s, however, the Indian Placement Program came under criticism. Supporters believed that exposure to white culture was beneficial to Native American children, and that it improved educational and economic opportunities, while critics believed the program undermined the children\u2019s Native American identity.  In 2000 the last student graduated from the program, though the program never was officially discontinued.  Matthew Garrett is currently an associate professor of history at Bakersfield College in California, teaching United States, California, and Native American Indian history courses. His dissertation and forthcoming book manuscript explore the LDS Indian Placement Program.  He is also a devoted husband and the father of three adorable little girls.",

      "description": "The Indian Placement Program was a program of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from 1947 to 2000, in which LDS Native American students were placed in LDS foster homes during the school year, where they would attend public schools and become assimilated into American culture. The program was initially developed to respond to the needs of Navajo teenagers and even younger children who were coming to parts of Utah to work. It was felt it would be better for them to get an education. Beginning in the 1970s, however, the Indian Placement Program came under criticism. Supporters believed that exposure to white culture was beneficial to Native American children, and that it improved educational and economic opportunities, while critics believed the program undermined the children\u2019s Native American identity.  In 2000 the last student graduated from the program, though the program never was officially discontinued.  Matthew Garrett is currently an associate professor of history at Bakersfield College in California, teaching United States, California, and Native American Indian history courses. His dissertation and forthcoming book manuscript explore the LDS Indian Placement Program.  He is also a devoted husband and the father of three adorable little girls.",

      "description": "In this podcast, Heather Olson Beal interviews three essayists who contributed to the book Mormon Women Have Their Say: Essays from the Claremont Oral History Collection: Caroline Kline (who also co-edited the book with Dr. Claudia Bushman), Anna Rolapp, and Elizabeth Mott.  In this podcast, we discuss the Claremont Women\u2019s Oral History Project in general and then discuss four essays in greater depth:  Caroline\u2019s essay on Mormon women\u2019s conceptions of the self, Anna\u2019s essay on Mormon women and California\u2019s Proposition 8, Elizabeth\u2019s essay on Mormon single women, and Caroline\u2019s essay on Mormon women\u2019s attitudes towards and feelings about patriarchy.  The Claremont Women\u2019s Oral History Project has collected hundreds of interviews with Mormon women of various ages, experiences, and levels of activity. These interviews record the experiences of these women in their homes and family life, their church life, and their work life, in their roles as homemakers, students, missionaries, career women, single women, converts, and disaffected members. Their stories feed into and illuminate the broader narrative of LDS history and belief, filling in a large gap in Mormon history that has often neglected the lived experiences of women. This project preserves and perpetuates their voices and memories, allowing them to say share what has too often been left unspoken. The silent majority speaks in these records. This volume is the first to explore the riches of the collection in print. A group of young scholars and others have used the interviews to better understand what Mormonism means to these women and what women mean for Mormonism. They explore those interviews through the lenses of history, doctrine, mythology, feminist theory, personal experience, and current events to help us understand what these women have to say about their own faith and lives.  Other essays address important topics, such as fertility, motherhood, adversity, womanliness, callings, revelation, missions, agency, the Relief Society,  and Heavenly Mother.",

      "description": "Ryan McIlvain was born in Utah and raised in Massachusetts. His fiction and nonfiction have appeared in many journals, including The Paris Review.  A graduate of the Rutgers MFA Program and a recipient of the Stegner Fellowship at Stanford, he currently lives with his wife in Los Angeles.  As part of Mormon Stories Book Club, today Heather Olson Beal and I discuss Ryan\u2019s book \u0022Elders,\u0022 which is the story of two young Mormon missionaries in Brazil and their tense, peculiar friendship.  Elder McLeod - outspoken, surly, a brash American - is nearing the end of his mission. For nearly two years he has spent his days studying the Bible and the Book of Mormon, knocking on doors, teaching missionary lessons \u0022experimenting on the word.\u0022 His new partner is Elder Passos, a devout, ambitious Brazilian who found salvation and solace in the church after his mother\u2019s early death. The two men are at first suspicious of each other, and their work together is frustrating, fruitless. That changes when a beautiful woman and her husband offer the missionaries a chance to be heard, to put all of their practice to good use, to test the mettle of their faith. But before they can bring the couple to baptism, they must confront their own long-held beliefs and doubts, and the simmering tensions at the heart of their friendship.  A novel of unsparing honesty and beauty, Elders announces Ryan McIlvain as a writer of enormous talent.",

Although both the RLDS Church and the LDS Church were faced with the same basic challenges in the societal transformation in North America after World War 2, the churches had completely opposite responses. In the wake of the challenges posed by professional scholarship of the \u0022New Mormon History,\u0022 RLDS leaders chose to \u0022embrace truth and do what is right, let the consequence follow,\u0022 rather than to retrench, deny, and retreat into territory that is intellectually indefensible. The path has not been an easy one, but it has led Community of Christ to become a church whose values include \u0022unity in diversity,\u0022 \u0022the worth of all persons,\u0022 and the principle that \u0022all are called.\u0022 Today, women serve at every level of church leadership, up to the First Presidency. Community of Christ has had apostles from Latin America, Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Pacific Islands, in addition to North America. LGBT members have full priesthood participation in North America and Australia, and in states and countries where it is legal, priesthood members may perform same-sex marriages as a sacrament in Community of Christ.",

Described by his biographer as a \u0022pragmatic prophet,\u0022 Joseph III was able to successfully weld diverse old Saints who had been Strangites, Cutlerites, Wightites, Whitermites, Rigdonites, Thompsonites, Brighamites, Morrisites, and more, into a Restoration tradition church that took the Kirtland era as its model.  The fact that Joseph III grew up in the ruins of Nauvoo and had learned to live with his neighbors influenced the Reorganization\u2019s strong peace tradition.",

John conceptually divides successor churches into three categories: (1) Those who sought to \u0022purify\u0022 the church and go back to an earlier form of Mormonism, (2) those who sought to \u0022preserve\u0022 the church as it existed in 1844, and (3) those who wanted to continue to \u0022innovate\u0022 by having a new prophet ever revealing new doctrine and practices on the model of the founder. John describes how polygamy continued to be the main point of contention and how the organizations of most of Brigham Young\u2019s rivals had faltered by 1860.",

John talks about the rapid evolution in Mormonism from its origins to 1844, its inherent tensions, and the direct causes of the schism that emerged after Brigham Young\u2019s showdown with Sidney Ridgon for church leadership in Nauvoo.",

      "description": "Simon Southerton is a native Australian, geneticist, former LDS bishop, and author of the book, Losing a Lost Tribe: Native Americans, DNA and the Mormon Church.  Simon was a member of the LDS church for almost 30 years, serving a mission in Melbourne (1981-83), marrying in the New Zealand Temple in 1983, and serving in numerous church positions including four terms as Young Men President,  a counselor in several bishoprics and branch presidencies, and finally as bishop.  While serving as bishop Simon began studying Native American DNA which he expected to have Middle Eastern origins, given the primary Book of Mormon narrative and longstanding church teachings to this effect.  Discovering instead that Native American DNA was almost 100% of Asiatic origin, this seriously challenged Simon\u2019s belief that the Lamanites are the ancestors of the American Indians, and that the Book of Mormon is a historical document.  Consequently, Simon resigned from his calling as bishop in 1998 and left the church soon thereafter.",

A non-Mormon, Dr. Mould nonetheless became very familiar with the Mormon experience in his field work. He immersed himself in a Mormon community, attending church meetings, family home evenings, and even father/son campouts. His perspectives on how Mormons experience, share, and interpret personal revelation is fascinating for anyone interested in Mormon studies or folklore studies in general.",

In this two-part interview, his incredibly quick and inquisitive mind is on full display, but it\u2019s his good humor and ability to use observations from everyday life, great literature, and important films to elucidate powerful philosophical and religious questions that will surely captivate listeners.

She divides her time between doing psychotherapy and coordinating the Stress Management and Biofeedback Services. Her interest in and experience with treating childhood sexual abuse began during her masters program in 1985 working as a volunteer counselor with AMACs (Adults Molested as Children). She received her Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology from BYU in 1997 and wrote her dissertation on adult men who had been sexually abused as children. Barbara began working in the BYU Counseling Center in 1996 and for many years was the sexual assault liaison between the center and the University Police, county law enforcement, and other agencies. Students who had been sexually assaulted were referred directly to her for immediate help and ongoing therapy. Dr. Morrell has served two LDS missions, one to Taiwan at the normal missionary age, and 10 years later she took a leave of absence from her work as a high school counselor for a second mission to Geneva Switzerland. She loves teaching in the Church and loved working for two years as a temple worker in the Provo temple.",

He and four others founded Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, for which he served as its first editor. He was instrumental in the creation of the Association for Mormon Letters, and he is considered the champion of the \u201Cpersonal essay\u201D as a powerful form for Mormon expression. England was a peace activist, whose reflections on having been present in the Vatican during the 1981 assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II (one of the bullets nicked his hand and left a small burn on his temple as it whizzed past) led him to found \u201CFood for Poland,\u201D a large-scale effort involving students from many college campuses to provide support for the Solidarity movement when it struggling under Polish government crack downs. He was an innovative and highly influential teacher. He revamped \u201Cstudy abroad\u201D programs at both BYU and Utah Valley State College, leading to unparalleled learning experiences for students who traveled with his groups to London. He supported and was an active voice for academic freedom at BYU, championed the rise of Mormon Studies at UVSC, and was an articulate voice and active supporter for nearly every good cause in independent Mormon circles for nearly four decades.

      "description": "Based on the success of our recent Mormon Stories Conference in New York City, we have decided to organize several local, Facebook-based communities of support for what we like to call uncorrelated (or intellectual/feminist/gay/politically liberal/inactive/post/ex) Mormons.  We have already created 32 groups, and hope to establish a support group for every major city/region in the world.  The idea behind each group will be to: 1) foster local, face-to-face communities of support for non-traditional Mormons, and 2) help to encourage healthy/constructive living amongst those for whom the traditional LDS Church experience is not adequate.  Note: this is NOT meant to replace the LDS church experience.  Instead, it is meant to augment the church experience (for those who still attend), or to provide community support for those who no longer feel comfortable attending church.  Some ideas we are hoping to foster include:  Monthly local meet-ups Book clubs/study groups Weekly play groups for children Annual youth conferences for teens College groups for Mormon university students (BYU/UVU and USU already created!) A dating service Service projects Annual conferences/retreats Etc. If you are interested in any of this, please check out our existing groups for a group near you.  If you would like to start your own local support group, please email us at: mormonstories@gmail.com",

      "description": "In this 2-part discussion, KC Kern (BookofMormonOnline.Net) speaks with Dr. Grant Hardy and his wife Heather Hardy.  Grant Hardy is Professor of History and Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina at Asheville. He has a B.A. in Ancient Greek from Brigham Young University and  Ph.D. in Chinese Language and Literature from Yale. He has authored Worlds of Bronze and Bamboo: Sima Qian\u2019s Conquest of History; The Establishment of the Han Empire and Imperial China; and Understanding the Book of Mormon: A Reader\u2019s Guide, as well as the Introduction for Royal Skousen\u2019s recent Yale edition of the Book of Mormon. He has also edited The Book of Mormon: A Reader\u2019s Edition; Enduring Ties: Poems of Family Relationships; and the Oxford History of Historical Writing. Vol. 1. His 36-lecture DVD/CD course for The Teaching Company entitled \u201CGreat Minds of the Eastern Intellectual Tradition\u201D will be released this summer.   Heather Hardy has a BS and an MBA from Brigham Young University (she says the latter seemed like a good idea when Grant was studying Greek; someone was going to have to support the family someday). She worked in university finances at Yale and then as the scholarship coordinator at BYU for a couple of years. She has published articles in Dialogue and the Journal of Book of Mormon Studies, but is mostly a full-time reader masquerading as a stay-at-home mother. Grant and Heather have been married for 28 years and have been talking to each other non-stop the whole time.  This interview is broken in two parts: Part 1:  Introductions, early personal, academic, and scholarly experiences, and approaching the Book of Mormon as world scripture and literature. Part 2:  Understanding the Book of Mormon: A Reader\u2019s Guide, thoughts on narrative structures, phraseology, historicity, evidences, anachronisms, Book of Mormon usage in the LDS Church, and on balancing faith and reason.",

He has also edited The Book of Mormon: A Reader\u2019s Edition; Enduring Ties: Poems of Family Relationships; and the Oxford History of Historical Writing. Vol. 1. His 36-lecture DVD/CD course for The Teaching Company entitled \u201CGreat Minds of the Eastern Intellectual Tradition\u201D will be released this summer.   Heather Hardy has a BS and an MBA from Brigham Young University (she says the latter seemed like a good idea when Grant was studying Greek; someone was going to have to support the family someday). She worked in university finances at Yale and then as the scholarship coordinator at BYU for a couple of years. She has published articles in Dialogue and the Journal of Book of Mormon Studies, but is mostly a full-time reader masquerading as a stay-at-home mother. Grant and Heather have been married for 28 years and have been talking to each other non-stop the whole time.  This interview is broken in two parts: Part 1:  Introductions, early personal, academic, and scholarly experiences, and approaching the Book of Mormon as world scripture and literature. Part 2:  Understanding the Book of Mormon: A Reader\u2019s Guide, thoughts on narrative structures, phraseology, historicity, evidences, anachronisms, Book of Mormon usage in the LDS Church, and on balancing faith and reason.",

      "description": "In this episode, John Dehlin interviews one of his former professors and mentors, Dr. William Bradshaw, on a wide variety of topics. Dr. Bradshaw has just recently retired from a rich and fulfilling career as a microbiology professor at BYU in which he influenced thousands of students to continually be open to the best thinking of the sciences while still nurturing a robust, mature faith and spiritual life. Many report Dr. Bradshaw\u2019s classes and their various interactions with him as pivotal to their finding a way to value the wisdom generated in both their heads and their hearts.  In this far-ranging discussion, Dr. Bradshaw takes us through the arc of his life, including his mission, experiences at Harvard, the circumstances of his career choice, and the surprise call he and his wife Marge received to serve as very young mission presidents in Hong Kong, during which service they had to wrestle with opening and closing missionary work in Vietnam. Dr. Bradshaw relates stories from his career at BYU, talks about science and religion issues, and reveals the way he faces challenges to his faith from Mormon history and scriptural studies.  Many Mormon Stories podcast listeners will already be familiar with one aspect of Dr. Bradshaw\u2019s life from Episode 191, which featured a recording of the most recent lecture he gave at BYU on the biological origins of homosexuality--a lecture he has arranged and given every year for the past several years. Dr. Bradshaw first became prompted to study the research on this subject when his son Brett came out about his homosexuality. Since that time, the Bradshaws have been active members in various LDS groups for families working to support their GLBT children. They are currently serving as the presidents of LDS Family Fellowship. Brett and his partner are married and living in California, where they are raising an adopted daughter.",

      "description": "Dan Wotherspoon interviews Allen D. Roberts and Curt Bench about the lasting legacy of Mormon forger, con man, and murderer Mark Hofmann.  Exactly twenty-five years ago, on the morning of 15 October 1985, Salt Lake City was rattled\u2014both literally and psychologically\u2014by the explosion of two bombs which each killed a person. The next day brought a third explosion, nearly killing Mark Hofmann, a well-known dealer in Mormon documents. Because of clues at that scene, investigators soon realized that perhaps Hofmann was not so much a third victim but the person actually responsible for all three bombs. In the course of the investigation, the tale of Mark Hofmann as a master forger and con artist began to unfold.  In this podcast, we examine the long and complex legacy of these murders and forgeries, as well as their continued reverberations even today. Although it is still unclear if Hofmann\u2019s intent was to bring down Mormonism through creating documents that challenged traditional presentations of early Church origins, he definitely was a serious student of Mormon history and knew where various controversies lay\u2014which he then exploited through the forged letters and documents he produced. This case has also presented challenges to some Latter-day Saints because of Hofmann\u2019s various meetings with Mormon general authorities who failed to detect that he was deceiving them, as well as because of the Church\u2019s practice of sometimes obtaining controversial documents and then suppressing them.  Joining Mormon Stories host Dan Wotherspoon to tell the story of these tragic murders and complex issues are two terrific guests: Allen Roberts, who co-authored with Linda Sillitoe the book Salamander: The Story of the Mormon Forgery Murders, which is widely regarded as the most thorough account of the Hofmann saga, and Curt Bench, who at the time of the bombings managed the Fine and Rare Books department of Deseret Book\u2019s flagship store in downtown Salt Lake City in which he dealt regularly with Mark Hofmann and even considered him a friend. Linda, Allen, and Curt all ended up playing important roles in helping investigators ultimately make their case against Hofmann and untangle the threads that had led him to murder.",

In this five-part interview conducted by Mormon Stories correspondent Dan Wotherspoon, Richard Dutcher speaks with remarkable candor about his upbringing and marriage, his career as a filmmaker, including extensive comments about each of his completed films (as well as ones, such as his planned film on Joseph Smith, that have not yet been made), the rise and decline of Mormon cinema, and his own faith journey.

Throughout the interview and via Richard\u0027s own personal story, we explore 3 ways in which the LDS Church creates unnecessary enemies: 1) By not being honest about its own history (e.g. teaching accurate history), 2) By breaking up families (when one no longer believes), and 3) By  harming the loved ones of those who have left the church.        To conclude (part 4), Richard discusses the benefits of religious belief in general and the LDS church specifically, along with the mission of the ExMormon foundation, and bears a final testimony regarding the joy/happiness he has experienced since leaving the church.         NOTE: The purpose of this interview is NOT to encourage people to stay or leave the LDS church.  It is simply to: 1) Seek to understand and to validate the path of those who have felt compelled to leave the church, and    2) Explore ways in which the church can seek to no longer create unnecessary enemies.",

      "description": "Janet Bennion is an associate professor of anthropology, specializing in alternative sexuality in nontraditional religious movements in the Intermountain West, specifically among Mormon fundamentalist polygynists. She has a Ph.D. in Anthropology from University of Utah and a Masters in Social Organization from Portland State University.        Her doctoral expertise lies in cross-cultural perspectives of sexuality, gender and society, and women of the fundamentalist world.         Her scientific publications include two major ethnographic works and two comparative analyses of Mormon polygynous women, as well as many peer-review journal articles. Women of Principle: Female Networking in Contemporary Mormon Polygyny (Oxford University Press 1998) offers an in-depth study of gender roles and sexual norms in the Apostolic United Brethren sect in the Bitterroot Mountains of Montana, cataloging women\u0027s conversion stories. This ethnography shows that while abuses do exist, some women achieve ironic ascendance and satisfaction in fundamentalism. Desert Patriarchy (University of Arizona Press 2004) presents her theory explaining the role of the desert environment (Chihuahua, Mexico) in the development and maintenance of a patriarchal gender ideology. Her model identifies several factors -- male supremacy, female network, non-secular education, imbalanced sex ratios, alternative sexuality, and circumscription -- which work to facilitate the longevity of desert patriarchal communities.",

      "description": "In early 1994 the distinguished career of Richard D. Poll, historian, professor, writer, husband and friend, came full circle. His Liahona/Iron-rod dichotomy, borrowed from the Book of Mormon, had entered the lexicon of Mormon thought almost 30 years earlier in his landmark essay\u0022What the Church Means to People Like Me\u0022 (Dialogue 2:4, Winter 1967). His\u0022Pillars of My Faith\u0022 sermon in Sunstone called for committed LDS worshipers and writers to join a mighty Christian chorus\u0022in which almost all the singers hear the dissonant sounds of the alternate voices as polyphonic enrichment of the message of the gospel music.\u0022 For people like him,\u0022neither dogmatic fundamentalism nor dogmatic humanism provides convincing answers to life\u0027s most basic questions.\u0022 He defined history as\u0022human strivings to discover divine realities.\u0022 Like Paul, Richard Poll lived his life as part of the leaven that\u0022leaveneth the whole lump\u0022 (Galatians 5:9), offering his Liahona questioning in the spirit of\u0022charity, humility, persistence.\u0022 In a time when men and women are being called sinners for a word (or many words); when the terms\u0022alternate\u0022 and\u0022dissident\u0022 are being redefined as sinister; when some seek apostasy, while others have apostasy thrust upon them, Richard Poll\u0027s calm, reasoned, compassionate voice rings with a clarity that will live on in our hearts and minds.",

It began the decade clearly rooted in the sectarian world view. But by the end of the decade, many of the church\u0027s leaders and a reasonable number of its members had adopted liberal views, down-playing traditional unique Latter Day Saint doctrines.                                Today, the RLDS Church (or Community of Christ) has but a fraction of the membership it once enjoyed.  What lessons can the LDS Church learn from the Community of Christ.  What did they do right, and wrong?",

      "description": "Today it is time to hear from one of the foremost voices on Women\u0027s Issues within Mormonism: Dr. Claudia Bushman. Dr. Bushman is a historian by training, and has taught at Columbia University for many years. She is the author of several books and articles, including:\u0022Mormon Sisters: Women of Early Utah\u0022 and\u0022Mormon Domestic Life in the 1870s: Pandemonium or Acadia\u0022. Perhaps most significantly, Dr. Bushman is one of the founders of Exponent II, a Boston-based magazine and now blog focused on feminism and women\u0027s issues within Mormonism. In this interview with Dr. Bushman, we learn what she means when she describes herself as a Mormon Feminist. She also recounts her involvement in the formation of Exponent II, as well as in the broader area of women\u0027s issues in the LDS church. To conclude, Dr. Bushman discusses her views on the critical role of women in the church today -- and how we, as a church, might work to better accommodate, and better utilize women in the 21st century.",

Consequently, in part 2 of this multi-part series on Women in the LDS Church, we will hear from an LDS woman who also teaches women\u0027s studies at a division 1 university in the US.  She will discuss the 3 major phases of feminism in the United States, trace its history from the mid 1800s to today, and will conclude with her own reflections about being an LDS woman in 2007.

In this episode, I discuss my marriage, the importance of the church to my family, and the experiences I had as a seminary teacher in Seattle that led to the dissolution of my testimony in the LDS Church (as I knew it).  I also discuss how the writings of Eugene England, Lowell Bennion, T. Edgar Lyon, Leonard Arrington, and others (in Sunstone and Dialogue) helped me to reconstruct my faith.",

In an age prior to professional image-makers, he instinctively grasped the importance of appearance, and coupled it to the substance of a professional educator to become an icon of Mormonism whose persona did much to change the negative image of the Church in much of the world.",

When I tried to talk with my mission president about the issue--it got messy. Today we claim 12\u002B million in the Church, but truth be told, less than 1/2 of them actually consider themselves Mormon....and thus the reason why activity rates are so closely guarded.",
