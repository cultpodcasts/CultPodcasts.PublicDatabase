      "title": "Episode 2027: Marc Hauser on giving children second chances to overcome trauma and lead happy lives",
      "description": "Everyone deserves a second chance. The former Harvard professor of psychology Marc D Hauser has had a controversial academic career, having been investigated in a high profile case in 2010 by Harvard for supposedly falsifying research data. But Hauser, who quit Harvard in 2011, remains prolific and has a new book out this week, Vulnerable Minds, focused - perhaps not uncoincidentally, given Hauser\u2019s own history - on giving children second chances to overcome trauma and thus lead happy lives. In our conversation, I didn\u2019t bring up Harvard\u2019s accusations against Hauser of fabricating and falsifying data. So I\u2019m noting it here, as a reminder that we all - children and adults alike - deserve second chances to fully realize ourselves. Marc Hauser, PhD, is an educator, neuroscientist, and the founder of Risk Eraser, a program that helps at-risk kids lead healthier lives. He is a former professor of evolutionary biology and psychology at Harvard University and the author of over three hundred papers. Named as one of the \u0022100 most connected men\u0022 by GQ magazine, Andrew Keen is amongst the world\u0027s best known broadcasters and commentators. In addition to presenting KEEN ON, he is the host of the long-running How To Fix Democracy show. He is also the author of four prescient books about digital technology: CULT OF THE AMATEUR, DIGITAL VERTIGO, THE INTERNET IS NOT THE ANSWER and HOW TO FIX THE FUTURE. Andrew lives in San Francisco, is married to Cassandra Knight, Google\u0027s VP of Litigation \u0026 Discovery, and has two grown children. Keen On is a reader-supported publication.
