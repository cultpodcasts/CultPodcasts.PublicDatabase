      "description": "Colin is working on a video on spiritual warfare in conservative/traditional catholicism, so we sat down this morning to talk through what spiritual warfare is, how it control peoples, some psychological ideas of why it takes a hold on folks, how it\u0027s used to influence politics, some internal consistencies, and some other things. Yes, this video is directly attacking church teaching and is quite condescending. Why? This teaching, more than almost any other, destroys peoples\u0027 lives and takes away peoples\u0027 rights. I\u0027m a fan of people choosing religious beliefs that work for them, but this realm is perhaps one of the worst parts of catholicism. Hence, the forceful speaking out.

She has many good memories, but also many bad memories from her time: an overbearing mother, purity culture, being in the closet, and catholic dating.

The goal of this podcast format is to to hear stories of people at the intersection of queer identity and religion. I\u0027ve shared plenty about my story and my own thoughts on my main channel, but I wanted to create a second channel dedicated to hearing others\u0027 stories - remaining in the church, leaving the church, finding a more accepting denomination, etc. Hopefully these stories can give you more of a perspective and help you make decisions for your faith journey.
