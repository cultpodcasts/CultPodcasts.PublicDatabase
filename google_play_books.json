As a child, however, she had none. Growing up as a member of the infamous cult The Children of God, Hough had her own self robbed from her. The cult took her all over the globe--to Germany, Japan, Texas, Chile--but it wasn\u0027t until she finally left for good that Lauren understood she could have a life beyond \u0022The Family.\u0022\n\nAlong the way, she\u0027s loaded up her car and started over, trading one life for the next. She\u0027s taken pilgrimages to the sights of her youth, been kept in solitary confinement, dated a lot of women, dabbled in drugs, and eventually found herself as what she always wanted to be: a writer. Here, as she sweeps through the underbelly of America--relying on friends, family, and strangers alike--she begins to excavate a new identity even as her past continues to trail her and color her world, relationships, and perceptions of self.\n\nAt once razor-sharp, profoundly brave, and often very, very funny, the essays in Leaving Isn\u0027t the Hardest Thing interrogate our notions of ecstasy, queerness, and what it means to live freely. Each piece is a reckoning: of survival, identity, and how to reclaim one\u0027s past when carving out a future.\n\n(P) 2021 Hodder \u0026 Stoughton Ltd\n\n\u2014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nLAUREN HOUGH was born in Germany and raised in seven countries and West Texas. She\u0027s been an airman in the U.S. Air Force, a green-aproned barista, a bartender, a livery driver, and, for a time, a cable guy. Her work has appeared in Granta, The Wrath-Bearing Tree, The Guardian, and HuffPost.

Isolated on a farm in Macau, she practised devotions and read letters of prophecy written by her grandfather, the leader of the now infamous cult, The Children of God. A direct decedent of the founding family, Faith featured in international media coverage \u2013 she was celebrated as extraordinary and then published doubly as a sharp reminder that she was not. \n\nWith indomitable grit, Faith created a world of her own, pilfering books and educating herself in secret. At the age of 23, she escaped, abandoning her history, her inheritance and her legacy. While her childhood friends succumbed to addiction, suicide and prostitution, Faith fought her way into Georgetown University and went on to establish a successful career in law. \n\nSex Cult Nun is an enthralling coming-of-age story that gives fascinating insight into the closed and complex world of extreme belief. Exploring the issues of psychological and physical control, Faith draws on her hard-won insight to interrogate the binaries of good and evil, and shed light on the insidiousness of oppression. At its heart, this extraordinary story is a stark warning about the consequences of surrendering our rights and responsibilities.\n\n\u2014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nFaith Jones is a lawyer, activist, entrepreneur, and business coach. She began her career as an attorney with Skadden Arps representing clients in a wide variety of cross-border corporate transactions and has worked with businesses and government leaders in the Pacific Rim.

Eventually these murders were connected to Cecilia Steyn and her cult, Electus per Deus (chosen by God). Members of the cult were willing to do anything for Cecilia \u2013 even if it meant committing murder. Who is Cecilia Steyn? How can one person manipulate five others to commit murder and perjury on her behalf? How did Satanism contribute to all of this? How did inexperienced criminals manage to evade capture for so long? Jana Marx answers these and other questions in this true-crime account that led to one of the most sensational murder cases in the country\u2019s history. Through interviews with those in the inner circle, evidence given in court and police files covering a period of four years, Marx attempts to answer the public\u2019s questions and provide a view of the inner workings of such a cult. Narrated and produced by Nicole Engelbrecht.\n\n\u2014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nJana Marx is an award-winning journalist, TV producer, and best-selling South African author with a successful track record of working in the media production industry. She is experienced in writing and storytelling for a variety of media platforms, including television, print, and online.

Using her skills as a creative writer with a passion for true crime, she crafts each script for the podcasts, to give listeners deep insight into the mechanics of the case and an understanding of the victims as human beings.\n\n\u2014\nAUDIOBOOK DETAILS\n\nPurchase on Google Play Books \u25BA\u25BA https://g.co/booksYT/AQAAAEDc8UKxjM\nLanguage: English\nPublisher: LAPA Publishers\nPublished on: December 15, 2020\nISBN: 9780639601977\nDuration: 9 hr, 0 min\nGenres: True Crime / General",

Four years later, the incendiary Rajneeshpuram commune in Oregon collapsed under the weight of audacious criminal conspiracies hatched in its inner sanctum, including the largest bioterrorism attack in US history, an unprecedented election fraud scheme, and multiple attempted murders.\n\nRajneeshpuram explores how this extraordinary spiritual community, featured in the Netflix docuseries Wild Wild Country, went so wrong. Drawing from extensive interviews with former disciples and an unprecedented review of commune records, government and police files, and archival materials, author Russell King probes the charismatic power that Bhagwan (later known as Osho) and Sheela exercised over the community and the turbulent legal and political environment that left commune leaders ready to deceive, poison, and even murder to preserve their home and their master.\n\nRajneeshpuram is a fresh examination of the Rajneesh story, using newly available information and interviews with high-ranking disciples who have never before shared their stories.\n\n\u2014\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nRussell King is a writer, investigator, and attorney. In 2018 he created the podcast Building Utopia: Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, which explores the history of Bhagwan and his disciples using an immersive narrative nonfiction approach. A former partner at an international law firm who specialized in complex litigation, King draws on his experience piecing together factual narratives based on contradictory evidence to tackle this rich and complicated history.\n\n\u2014\nAUDIOBOOK DETAILS\n\nPurchase on Google Play Books \u25BA\u25BA https://g.co/booksYT/AQAAAEACnFHcQM\nLanguage: English\nPublisher: Blackstone Publishing\nPublished on: March 8, 2022\nISBN: 9798200894826\nDuration: 11 hr, 30 min\nGenres: Religion / Cults, True Crime / General",
