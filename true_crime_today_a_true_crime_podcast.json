This episode delves into the behavioral dynamics between Chad Daybell and Lori Vallow, exploring how Vallow\u0027s alleged manipulative nature may have influenced Daybell to commit crimes under the guise of love and financial gain. Dreeke discusses the psychological aspects of the case, including the concept of narcissism and manipulation. He raises questions about Daybell\u0027s self-awareness versus delusional thinking and examines how these factors intersect with criminal behavior.
