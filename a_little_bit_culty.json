Also hard to watch. Also a bit infuriating. In other words: A culty docuseries. If you\u2019ve already followed the Duggars, the reality TV mega-family behind the hit show 19 Kids and Counting, you know it\u2019s all a lot to process. Shiny Happy People gets deep into the weeds of the story behind their story: Chock-full of disturbing insights into their scandals, their demons, and the radical organization underpinning the whole shitshow. That would be the  Institute in Basic Life Principles, an evangelical Christian ministry on steroids.\u00A0 Lindsey Williams is featured in Shiny Happy People, and is here to talk with us in this episode about her experience as a former IBLP member, and her personal journey from dug in to \u201Cfuck this I\u2019m out.\u201D Our chat covers IBLP founder Bill Gothard and his deranged dogma, what it was like living in the orbit of the embattled Duggar clan, and how Lindsey is doing now that she\u2019s a self-proclaimed Shiny Happy Warrior for cult awareness.\u00A0 And just as a heads up, please know that this IBLP organization has some seriously shady philosophies on things like sexual abuse, so this episode may get into gritty territory.

      "description": "This epiosde is sponsored by Better Help. Hey Listener, you asked for a greatest hits medley of all our NXIVM related guests in one or two meaty episodes.And hear ye, hear ye we have delivered. This is our second NXIVM extravaganza, and we hope you dig it. We\u2019ll be back soon with all new episodes, and until then you can always hang out with us on Patreon at patreon.com/alittlebitculty if you can\u2019t get enough of our culty, culty content.\u00A0  But now\u2026let\u2019s dig into the main course shall we? Keith Raniere\u2019s trial was at the center of The Vow Season 2 \u2013\u00A0and this episode is taking you even further into the courtroom circus. \u00A0 We\u2019re featuring insights from three people who had as close a look as one could get. \u00A0 First, you\u2019ll hear from Moira Kim Penza \u2013\u00A0the prosecutor who brought Keith Raniere to justice. Her accomplishments are mighty: Like Keith\u2019s conviction on all counts including racketeering and sex trafficking and a brisk 120 year sentence. Moira\u2019s groundbreaking approach to the case has been credited with paving the way for other sex trafficking prosecutions against powerful individuals. In other words: She\u2019s a total badass. In this episode, Moira sits down with Sarah and Nippy to talk about what it\u2019s like to take on a world-class dirtbag (our wording, not hers) and what really chaps her ass about NXIVM\u2019s Voldemort.  More about today\u2019s guest: Moira is now in private practice as a litigator, and a partner at Wilkinson Stekloff. Crain\u2019s New York business named her in the 40 under 40 list, she\u2019s been ranked as one of Bloomberg Law\u2019s 40 under 40, and her legal analysis has been featured in The NY Times, CNN, ABC, NPR and Daily Beast.\u00A0 \u00A0 Next you\u2019ll hear from Robert Gavin.  Robert\u00A0 has been a news reporter for 28 years, having also worked for two years as an editor. Originally from Staten Island, Gavin began his career by covering the New York City police and fire departments, the NYS Capitol, State and Federal Courts, various murder trials, and cases involving terrorism, the mafia, street gangs, and political corruption. And eventually, Robert\u2019s role in the NXIVM trials and their coverage would play a crucial part in bringing down Keith Raniere. \u00A0 Finally, you\u2019ll hear from\u00A0 Vanessa Grigoriadis, who is an award-winning longform journalist and podcaster, having published profiles on the likes of Karl Lagerfeld, Lady Gaga, and Arianna Huffington. So how did she get tied up in NXIVM\u2019s bullshit while also reporting on the cult? Well, the short answer is: anyone and everyone is susceptible to coercive control and persuasion, even members of the press. The long answer? Well, you\u2019ll just have to listen to find out.\u00A0 \u00A0 Without further adieu. Here\u2019s our NXIVM medley part two.

      "description": "This episode is sponsored by Better Help.\u00A0 Well hello there, A Little Bit Culty listener. How\u2019d your summer go? What\u2019s the haps? This is actually our out of office greeting talking to you, because we\u2019re away from the studio right now investigating some kickass episodes for our new season. But we didn\u2019t want to leave you hanging\u2026so we went through the archives to make you a veritable Dairy Queen Blizzard of culty goodness from some of our fan favorites. We\u2019ll be back soon with all new episodes, but until then you can also find us each week on Patreon where we\u2019re serving up fresh episodes and content on the regular.  So today\u2019s episode is\u2026well\u2026in our wheelhouse. If you\u2019re a listener of this particular show, you\u2019re already familiar with NXIVM \u2013\u00A0but on today\u2019s episode we are taking a closer look at the cult featured in the HBO series, The Vow, starring yours truly. (Whose got four thumbs and once helped bring NXIVM down? THESE GUYS).  Joining us are 4 people who understand the inner workings of NXIVM\u00A0 better than almost anyone else. First up is Mark Vicente. He\u2019s The Vow\u2019s Stone cold silver fox, a film-maker turned whistleblower, and an internationally renowned sweetheart. He\u2019s the guy who originally recruited me, and the guy who raised hell to help bring it all down.\u00A0 Also, he\u2019s the lucky husband of the one and only Bonnie Piesse, aka, Bonfire.  Next is India Oxenberg, who went through hell and back in NXIVM\u2019s darkest chapter: DOS. From forced starvation, and sleep deprivation, to multiple forms of mental and sexual abuse, to a devastating years-long separation from her family. God damn we\u2019re glad she got out and that she\u2019s THRIVING now. .\u00A0 \u00A0 Ater India, we\u2019ve got Susan Dones\u2026.The one-woman wrecking crew who served as her own legal representation in a series of court battles after she left the organization. Susan was way ahead of the curve on calling bullshit Keith Raniere and his flying monkeys. She also paid dearly for it.\u00A0 \u00A0 And finally, is Karen Unterrainer, who at only 18-years-old,\u00A0 became romantically intertwined with Keith Raniere. Over the next 40 years, she\u2019d go on to become a top level NXIVM trainer, a key figure of the Executive Success Programs\u2019 leadership committee, and an overseer of administration (bookkeeping) and IT.\u00A0 Which is all to say: There is much tea to spill. So much tea.  So if you\u2019re sick of hearing us talk about NXIVM, you better turn around now. You\u2019ve been warned. Everybody else? Let\u2019s rock.

It\u2019s ANOTHER remix episode of A Little Bit Culty because: It\u2019s always good to take some time to look back and reflect.\u00A0 PLUS we\u2019re currently working our tails off on a batch of all new, farm fresh episodes for a brand new season. Until then, you can always join us over on Patreon - that\u2019s patreon.com/alittlebitculty for new weekly episodes, adfree, and other treats.\u00A0 But right now? We\u2019re about to get in the weeds of one of our favorite topics with some of our fan favorites.\u00A0 On todays episode we are diving head first into the fucked up world of abstinence pledges, purity rings, and knee length skirts. That\u2019s right, we are going deep in the purity culture discussion and we aren\u2019t pulling out. \u00A0 Joining us are three powerhouse guests. \u00A0 First is the most rockin\u2019 reverend we\u2019ve ever met. \u00A0 Nadia Bolz-Weber is an ordained Lutheran Pastor, and founder of House for All Sinners \u0026 Saints in Denver:\u00A0 a progressive, queer-inclusive Lutheran congregation. She\u2019s written three New York Times bestselling memoirs, including Shameless: A Sexual Reformation, which takes on what she sees as the harmful ideas about sexuality that Christianity has promoted throughout history. She\u2019s the creator and host of The Confessional podcast, a pop-up prayer network called The Chapel, and a wildly inspirational Substack called The Corners.\u00A0 \u00A0 Next up is Alice Greczyn - an actress, author, and founder of Dare to Doubt. Her story includes a painful yet rewarding transition from Christianity to atheism, a journey that inspired her to found DaretoDoubt.org, a resource site for people detaching from belief systems they come to fnd harmful.\u00A0 \u00A0 And last, and probably least, Eric Skwarczynski is the host and creator of the Preacher Boys podcast, which is a platform for survivors\u2019 stories about a deeply disturbing pattern of sexual predation and abuse claims within the Independent Fundamental Baptist movement.\u00A0 \u00A0 You won\u2019t want to miss a single second of todays show, so let\u2019s get started with our personal Fuck You to Purity Culture, featuring Nadia Bolz Weber, Alice Greczyn, and Eric Skwarczynski.

      "description": "Today\u2019s episode is sponsored by BetterHelp. We\u2019re back with another greatest hits mashup this week, pulled together from the Little Bit Culty archives for your late listening pleasure because\u2026well\u2026we can\u2019t quit you - not even for a short late summer, early fall hiatus. Can you believe some shows go on hiatus? LAMMMMMME! Not us. Breaks are for babies.\u00A0  For real though, while we\u2019re working on fresh batches of cult-busting brand new episodes, we wanted to stir that proverbial pot a little more by revisiting one of our favorite culty topics\u2026.Scientology.  AKA, the brainchild of L. Ron.\u00A0 You know it, you loathe it, or\u2026maybe you just mock it. To be fair, unless you\u2019re a Scientologist, they think you\u2019re pretty silly too. So it\u2019s all even-stevens  We are diving deep into the Danger Zone in this episode \u2013\u00A0featuring 3 top guns who have taken on the Impossible Mission of exposing Scientology \u2013\u00A0which we all know can be Risky Business.  Ok, enough Tom Cruise puns \u2013\u00A0let\u2019s introduce A Few Good Men \u2013\u00A0and a super badass woman \u2013\u00A0who you\u2019ll hear from on today\u2019s show.  First up is the patron saint of cult-busting, Leah Remini, who\u2019s book Troublemaker chronicles her remarkable journey toward emotional and spiritual freedom from Scientology, both for herself and for her family.  Next is Mike RInder. Having spent his youth doing things like, for example, swabbing the decks of L. Ron Hubbard\u2019s yacht, Rinder eventually made it into the elite sect of Scientology known as the Sea Organization, eventually becoming Scientology\u2019s International Spokesperson and the head of its Office of Special Affairs. Then, he escaped and became a fearless and outspoken ex-member.  Last is Jon Atack \u2013 one of the only court-appointed expert witnesses on Scientology, and his book:  Let\u2019s Sell These People a Piece of Blue Sky, about the early history of the church, is cited by academics all over the world.

In addition to his work podcasting as a  Scientology mythbuster\u00A0 and using his Instagram account to help educate people on overcoming things like manipulation, destructive cults, and abusive relationships, he\u2019s written several novels, including  Voodoo Child (Slight Return), inspired by the life and downfall of Jimi Hendrix. \u00A0 Without further ado\u2026please enjoy this Scientology Sucks, Sorry Not Sorry, A Little Bit Culty Medley.\u00A0 \u00A0 Also\u2026  Let it be known far and wide, loud and clear that\u2026  The views and opinions expressed on A Little Bit Culty do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the podcast.

Rebecca Bender grew up in a small town, played varsity sports, made high school honor roll, and would have started college early except she got pregnant. She was a little ostracized. And a lot lonely. Then she fell in love \u2014 kind of. She followed her knight in shining armor to Las Vegas only to be sold among three human traffickers.\u00A0 She was branded, thrown in jail, and hospitalized, her face broken in five different places. But she wasn\u2019t kidnapped. And there was no duct tape involved.\u00A0 Now, Rebecca Bender is a mentor/survivor/expert flipping the script on who leads the fight to eradicate human trafficking. She\u2019s blazing trails with the largest online school in the world for survivors. And, as an internationally recognized subject matter expert, she\u2019s equipped the FBI, Homeland Security, and the US Department of Justice to spot this stuff before it gets any worse.

The oldest of seven siblings, Hayley managed to escape her marriage and the Church to live her life as an out-and-proud lesbian while still maintaining a real (albeit heavily strained) relationship with some of her family. In doing so, she learned that perhaps her family\u2019s belief that life is about sacrifice and being miserable means you\u2019re doing something right is NOT the most fun way to live life!\u00A0 Now, it\u2019s safe to say Morgan is making all her decisions for herself as a prominent fitness and yoga instructor, and is much happier for it.\u00A0 \u00A0 Follow Morgan on Instagram Visit Morgan\u2019s website\u00A0 \u00A0 Please note, this series includes details of sexual abuse.

Having achieved nation-wide fame on America\u2019s Got Talent, the Willis Fishers scored their own reality show in 2015, letting cameras into their pristine and heavily Christian home to document the daily lives of a happy, smiley family trying to make it in the famously non-toxic (just kidding) entertainment biz.\u00A0 So when allegations of child abuse and molestation broke out against the family\u2019s patriarch, Toby Willis, Americans and onlookers across the globe were in disbelief. How could this family, which had been put on a pedestal and idolized extensively as \u201Cpicture perfect,\u201D possess such insanely disturbing secrets?\u00A0 Because the world is fucked up, hellooo! But our listeners already knew that.\u00A0 On today\u2019s episode, Jessica joins us to discuss her story, as well as parallels she sees between her family and others that shared the reality show spotlight. She\u2019s begun releasing new music again as a form of healing\u2014you can check out her album Brand New Day\u00A0here.

      "description": "This episode is sponsored by BetterHelp. NXIVM\u2019s timeline unfolds like a (horror) film with its own subplots. One of the cult\u2019s best known smaller mythologies was its ability to cure Tourette\u0027s Syndrome, which is a condition in the nervous system that causes tics like sudden and uncontrollable movements or vocal outbursts. It should be noted that while there are certainly various treatments for managing TS, there is still no known cure.\u00A0 This explains why today\u2019s guest, Isabella Constantino, was attracted to NXIVM and the extraordinary results they were boasting about with their TS study. Ultimately, Constantino wound up postponing her last semester of college and moving to Albany in order to engrain herself in the study and to pursue personal growth, both of which she did for a total of three years before finally escaping. Now, she\u2019s spent half a decade recovering her \u201Csense of self\u201D and navigating life post-NXIVM.\u00A0 But how did NXIVM actually approach this \u201Cscientific\u201D study, and what abusive methods did they apply from their typical conditioning in order to combat Tourette\u2019s? Lastly, did any of their techniques actually help with TS, and if so, at what cost?\u00A0 \u00A0 For more about Isabella Constanto, check out her site, Instagram, and Facebook:\u00A0 Website Instagram Facebook \u00A0 Please note, this series includes details of sexual abuse.

For example, we have the Duggar family and their show 19 and Counting, which broadcasted the daily lives of Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar and their army of children between 2008 and 2015 to millions of viewers around the world. Now, a new documentary on the family called Shiny Happy People, according to TIME, \u201Cincludes testimonies from daughter Jill (Duggar) Dillard, her husband Derick Dillard, niece Amy (Duggar) King, as well as several former IBLP members, reveals that the family and larger religious group was dealing with allegations of sex abuse, child abuse and financial mistreatment.\u201D Our guest today, author Tia Levings, spoke in this documentary based on her experiences as a thought leader on abuse within Christian Fundamentalism, but also a survivor of such abuse herself. Having grown up in a Southern Baptist Megachurch, Levings gets into how she slowly but surely slipped into a high-control group (read: cult) wherein men are considered accountable for their wives before God, and therefore must lead and discipline them.\u00A0 Her memoir, A Well-Trained Wife, will be released in August of 2024.

This judgment will be an end to this harrowing yet enthralling story, which turned 49-year-old mom and Mormon, Lori Vallow into an international media fixture, seemingly entangled in a web of infanticide, zombies, escapes to Hawaii, and a trail of mysterious deaths that remain suspicious as hell.\u00A0  On today\u2019s episode, we\u2019re joined by freelance journalist and author Leah Sottile, whose book  When the Moon Turns to Blood: Lori Vallow, Chad Daybell, and a Story of Murder, Faith, and End Times, illuminates the story of the former beauty queen and her grave-digger turned doomsday novelist slash extremist douchebag husband, Chad.

If hell is real, there is perhaps no circle of it as harrowing nor vile as the experience of growing up in the Children of God cult. Still active under the name \u201CThe Family International,\u201D the group is known for being a real-life manifestation of the shittiest of shitty macabre practices, such as child sexual abuse involving their \u201CLaw of Love,\u201D\u2014a mandate for females of all ages to show Jesus their love by letting men straight up rape them.\u00A0  One would hope that growing up in COG would be the last coercive, abusive, and negligent experience for today\u2019s guest, Daniella Mestyanek Young, who is an American author, keynote speaker, and previous Captain in the US Army. One would also hope for ponies and rainbows and a bigger tax return this year but HEY, life\u2019s no cake walk. On today\u2019s episode, Young discusses her book Uncultured: a Memoir, wherein she details her cult-riddled childhood and how, shockingly, the US Army reflected comparable practices.\u00A0  But how?

While there is of course no shortage of fake news out there, the main goal of the press is to keep society honest, investigating everything from corrupt governments to those cute little cliques we like to call cults.\u00A0  Robert Gavin has been a news reporter for 28 years, having also worked for two years as an editor. Originally from Staten Island, Gavin began his career by covering the New York City police and fire departments, the NYS Capitol, State and Federal Courts, various murder trials, and cases involving terrorism, the mafia, street gangs, and political corruption. And eventually, Robert\u2019s role in the NXIVM trials and their coverage would play a crucial part in bringing down Keith Raniere, which we\u2019re sure you saw on HBO\u2019s \u201CThe Vow.\u201D On today\u2019s episode, we talk to Gavin about his time covering the cult, as well as the aftermath.\u00A0  Please note, this series includes details of sexual abuse.

He became a worship leader, was on his way to become a priest, and was committed to all things Jesus Christ until he realized that, perhaps, his entire life was built around something he wasn\u2019t sure he actually believed in.\u00A0  In today\u2019s episode, Will discusses his time in the church, navigating through toxic groups, leaders and doctrine, his deconstruction, and how he feels about religion today.\u00A0  Follow Will Retherford on Instagram and Citizens of Sound.

Naas\u00F3n Joaqu\u00EDn Garc\u00EDa, the ongoing leader of the Light of the World non-traditional La Luz Del Mundo (LLDM) church is currently serving a maximum of 16 years and 8 months in prison for the sexual abuse of minors. The self-proclaimed \u201CApostle of God\u201D was eventually denied bail after setting that bail at $50 million, which according to the California Attorney General, was the highest ever imposed on an individual by the Los Angeles County. The denial came about because prosecutors feared his extremely loyal followers might actually raise the cash.\u00A0  We spoke to Sochil Martin who was born into the LLDM and broke away from it after a lifetime of abuse. The outspoken survivor and whistleblower shares her experience\u2013from being raised in church\u2019s clutches and ultimately fleeing, to helping federal agents bring Garc\u00EDa to justice, and how she\u2019s healing now.

War was still going on in Vietnam, and those back in the US of A were struggling with political, societal, and economic changes. One day, Diane Benscoter passed a van where some strangers were giving out bananas. She grabbed a snack and avoided making conversation with the van people. Shortly after, she was on a five-day trek from Omaha to Des Moines with those banana enthusiasts, who were in fact Sun Myung Moon enthusiasts. Next thing you know, Diane\u2019s cut off all of her hair, done some fasting, and has dedicated five years to selling candy and flowers while devoted to the second coming of Christ.\u00A0  You can read all about this in her memoir, linked out below. But on today\u0027s episode, we\u2019re focusing on Diane\u2019s organization, Antidote, which helps people escape from cults, or to get their loved ones out of cults and extremist mentalities such as those shared by QAnon. Having experienced cult life herself, Diane knows that convincing someone that everything they hold true in their life is a vicious lie can be next to impossible.

But while we\u2019ve traditionally reserved our coverage of The Vow for said exclusive cult\u2014sorry, I mean club\u2014we\u2019re making an exception today and sharing some of it with all of our listeners. If you like what you hear, just know there\u2019s plenty more of it available for an extremely agreeable price. If you\u2019re not interested, don\u2019t worry, we still love you! Just less. (Kidding)\u00A0  On today\u2019s episode, we\u2019re recapping our feelings about the entire second season with special guest Ayla Fitzpatrick, who previously worked in Albany, New York at News10ABC covering NXIVM, focusing on Keith Raniere\u2019s arrest and the ensuing trial. Even though she\u2019s no longer a journalist, she loves to keep up to date with all things cultiverse\u2014just like you guys!  So what did we think about being featured less heavily in this season? Did NXIVM actually cure Tourette\u2019s syndrome (hint: no!), and was the whole documentation and conversation around this triggering or retraumatizing for us?

If you were Black, you were particularly ostracized and lived in constant danger as a second class citizen (if only this weren\u2019t still true today). And so it\u2019s no real surprise that when people like Jamiyla Chisholm\u2019s father heard about a religious community that would, as Jamiyla put it, protect them from the hellish world and teach them how \u201Cthey should live as Black people,\u201D they were drawn like moths to a flame.\u00A0  While we\u2019ve seen time and time again that cults prey on the vulnerable, this often takes advantage of an individual\u2019s current mental, financial, or even physical state. In this particular case, one leader took advantage of nation-wide racial tensions in order to seduce hundreds of people into his community, which merged practices from Islam, Judaism, and various political ideologies.\u00A0  Who was this leader? Well, we don\u2019t want to give it all away\u2026but here\u2019s a hint: the supreme douchebag is serving 135 years in prison for what\u2019s been reported as the largest prosecution of child molestation ever directed at an individual in the history of the USA.\u00A0  To find out who we\u2019re talking about, tune in to hear author, journalist, storyteller and educator Jamiyla Chisholm discuss her own experience as a member of this cult, as detailed in her memoir, The Community.\u00A0  Jamiyla\u2019s Website Jamiyla\u2019s Instagram Jamiyla\u2019s Twitter Buy  The Community: A Memoir  Also\u2026  Hear Ye, Hear Ye:  The views and opinions expressed on A Little Bit Culty do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the podcast.

But one person they really hate is Mike Rinder. How could anyone hate someone who\u2019s last name sounds like reindeer, especially just a few weeks after Santa made his international rounds on that reindeer-driven slay? Well, having spent his youth doing things like, for example, swabbing the decks of L. Ron Hubbard\u2019s yacht, Rinder eventually made it into the elite sect of Scientology known as the Sea Organization, eventually becoming Scientology\u2019s International Spokesperson and the head of its Office of Special Affairs. Then, he escaped and became a fearless and outspoken ex-member. If you didn\u2019t listen to the first interview we did with Mike, we\u2019re officially mad at you! But we can forgive and forget\u2014just check it out  here.\u00A0  So why did we have him back on the show? Because he\u2019s so fucking lovely. Also, because he just released his new memoir: A Billion Years: My Escape From a Life in the Highest Ranks of Scientology. It\u2019s a batshit crazy and exclusive, first-hand look into the inner workings of Scientology and the harm this organization does to its brainwashed members. And in today\u0027s episode, we specifically get into how Scientology could potentially come to an end (hint: it involves the IRS no longer putting up with the \u201Cchurch\u2019s\u201D bullshit).\u00A0  So say a little prayer to Xenu and strap on in, cuz this one\u2019s a wild ride!\u00A0  Buy  A Billion Years: My Escape From a Life in the Highest Ranks of Scientology Mike\u2019s blog Mike\u2019s Website  Mike\u2019s Facebook Mike\u2019s Instagram  Also\u2026  Hear Ye, Hear Ye:  The views and opinions expressed on A Little Bit Culty do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the podcast.

      "description": "This episode is sponsored by Better Help and was originally released on Zen Parenting Radio. Here\u2019s a scary thought: fully-grown adults are susceptible to cults, or cult-adjacent behavior (there is truly cultish influence all around us in politics, wellness communities, and so on). So imagine how dangerous this whole world is for children, who are far less likely to have the wherewithal to identify and refute coercive persuasion. If you\u2019re one of our regular listeners, you already know how ubiquitous this shit is (unfortunately); so what can we do to protect our youth?\u00A0  Well, that\u2019s exactly what we got into with our friends over at Zen Parenting Radio, where Cathy Cassani Adams (a self proclaimed \u201Cspiritual and emotional mom\u201D) and Todd Adams (\u201Ca logical and practical dad\u0027\u0027) get into all things parenting. On their show, we not only recount our own story with NXIVM (perhaps you\u2019ve heard about, read about, or seen it by now?), but also the importance of talking to kids about how relationships that might initially feel exciting or just \u201Cgood\u201D in some way\u2014friends, coaches, teachers, bosses, etc.\u2014can quickly pivot into something abusive. How can we teach kids to identify culty behavior and help them feel safe enough to ask for help?\u00A0  This one\u2019s for anyone who believes we need to keep our kids safe from evil, shitty shitheads.

It\u2019s crazy to think that, for the first 31 years of her life, Payton was actually living something more similar to The Culty Clarkson show (we\u2019re so sorry, we had to try), having grown up in Northern California within a community that her grandparents originally joined as a non-denominational bible study club before it turned into a fear and shame-based cult, ruled by a wacky shithead who loved \u201Cmarking\u201D (ex-communicating) anyone who questioned him, and who also forbid women from wearing pants or basically being like, humans with any rights or autonomy whatsoever.\u00A0Fun!

But few people have lived that story quite like Karen Unterreiner did when, at only 18-years-old, she became romantically intertwined with Keith Raniere. Over the next 40 years, she\u2019d go on to become a top level NXIVM trainer, a key figure of the Executive Success Programs\u2019 leadership committee, and an overseer of administration (bookkeeping) and IT.  Now free of Raniere\u2019s coercive control (read: fuckery), Unterreiner has spent the last five years recovering and discovering her true self. For today\u2019s episode, we spoke with her about dating an actual monster, how NXIVM functioned as a company, (and why it was messy), and whether or not the technology they used was actually any good, or more like rubbing two sticks together.\u00A0  Also\u2026  Hear Ye, Hear Ye:  The views and opinions expressed on A Little Bit Culty do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the podcast.

Enter licensed marriage and family therapist Diane Dierks with Dr. Rick Voyles, the CEO of the Center of Dispute Solutions, and their fabulously insightful podcast \u201CCo-Parent Dilemmas,\u201D which aims to provide practical solutions to families struggling with co-parenting.\u00A0  We\u2019re lucky to have these two experienced smarties on the show with us to discuss a specific and controversial topic: what some refer to as \u201Cthe alienating parent,\u201D which relates heavily to one of our favorite topics on this show (although least favorite things in like, \u201Creal life\u201D), the cult of one. Now, the National Center for State Courts defines parental alienation as \u201Ca strategy whereby one parent intentionally displays to the child unjustified negativity aimed at the other parent.\u201D But why has the term brought up some of that good ol\u2019 conflict we mentioned amongst clinicians today, dividing those who use the term and those who refuse to?

      "description": "This episode is sponsored by BetterHelp. The Latin root for the word \u201Ccoercive\u201D literally means to surround, encompass, restrain, confine, and so on. So what does \u201Ccoercive control\u201D look like in real life, you ask? Well, it could involve isolating someone away from friends and family, depriving them of basic human needs (food, water, etc.), humiliating them, managing someone else\u2019s finances, and the like. If it\u2019s a shitty way of controlling another human, like having an invisible chain wrapped around their ankles, it\u2019s coercive control. If you want a pop culture reference, look no further than Britney Spears\u2019 \u201CToxic\u201D family usurping her finances and personal agency for her nearly 14-year conservatorship.\u00A0  But does it still feel abstract? Then you need to listen to today\u2019s episode, complete with special guest Dr. Christine Cocchiola, a coercive control advocate, researcher, educator, and survivor, (meaning she\u2019s able to speak on the subject from both personal and scholarly levels). During our talk, she breaks down how narcissism, shame, egos, and \u201Cperfect preys\u201D play out with everyone from romantic partners to people in power, such as cult leaders.\u00A0  Are you perhaps being controlled by someone without even realizing it?

Unfortunately, such marriages were insanely frequent within the church, with girls as young as 12-years-old being groomed and forced to marry older men. Much of this is thanks to human trash can Warren Jeffs, president and prophet of the FLDS, who can also add convicted child rapist to his list of titles. At one point, Jeffs had 78 \u201Cwives,\u201D 24 of whom were children. Now, he\u2019s serving life in prison, with no small help from Elissa Wall.\u00A0  Wall\u2019s autobiography is titled,  Stolen Innocence: My Story of Growing Up in a Polygamous Sect, Becoming a Teenage Bride, and Breaking Free of Warren Jeffs.

Our guests today want you to know that culty shit is rampant in high performance gymnastics, and it didn\u2019t all magically go away with Larry Nassar\u2019s prison sentence. How are these abusive creeps still slipping through the system and continuing to get access to young athletes? How do you protect your kid from harm if they develop a passion for the sport? Kim Shore is the founder of Gymnasts for Change Canada, a collective that emerged on the heels of the #metoo movement in 2017 after several former elite athletes publicly shared their experiences of abuse. She\u2019s joined by fellow advocate and former Canadian national team gymnast Melanie Hunt, who is sharing her own grisly account of psychological, physical, and sexual abuse at the hands of her coaches during her fifteen-year career. The duo chats with us about their stories and their shared mission of eradicating abuse from the sport that they love. Because the scariest thing about gymnastics should be the balance beam. This episode is a must-hear for parents who are raising student athletes in any sport, but be warned: It\u2019s not easy listening.

      "description": "This episode is sponsored by BetterHelp. Dr. Marlene Winell\u00A0 knows all too well that exiting a controlling religion can trigger a devastating life crisis. As a college student, she moved away from the fire and brimstone fundamentalist Christianity she was raised in, and the fallout of her exodus was so dramatically upending that she felt compelled to dedicate her life\u2019s work to studying the very phenomenon that she\u2019d later coin:\u00A0 \u2018Religious Trauma Syndrome.\u2019 In this episode of A Little Bit Culty she chats with us about symptoms that arise in response to traumatic or stressful religious experiences, and what can be helpful along the road to recovery after leaving the fold.  More About Our Guest: Dr. Winell is a psychologist, educator, and writer whose background includes 30 years of experience in human services, in both community and academic settings. She holds a doctorate in Human Development and Family Studies from Pennsylvania State University and is the author of Leaving the Fold: A Guide for Former Fundamentalists and Others Leaving their Religion. Leaving the Fold has become a leading self-help book in the field of religious recovery - and examines the effects of authoritarian religion (namely fundamentalist Christianity) on individuals who leave the faith.\u00A0 She\u2019s also the founder of Journey Free organization, which is dedicated to helping people transition out of harmful religions, recover from trauma, and rebuild their lives. We\u2019ve developed programs for both individuals and groups. If you are recovering from religious harm, we have great respect for your strength and courage.

      "description": "This show/episode is brought to you by BetterHelp. There are unconventional childhoods, and then there is growing up in the Children of God. International attorney, humanitarian, author, and TEDx speaker Faith Jones was raised in this infamous cult founded by her paternal grandfather in 1968. The group, later referred to as \u201Cthe Family,\u201D was notorious for its radical practices, which required members to become fulltime missionaries, give up their income and formal education, and abide by the \u201CLaw of Love,\u201D a doctrine which encouraged spouse sharing, sexual relations with children, and the \u201CFlirty Fishing\u201D practice of using female followers as sex-bait to reel in followers. Thank gravy that Faith emancipated herself at 23, was later accepted into Berkeley Law school, and now travels the world advocating for everything that is NOT Children of God-like. She joins us in this first of two episodes to talk about Sex Cult Nun, her scorching memoir of her life inside the secretive cult.

Is culty behavior inevitable once you\u2019ve reached rockstar levels of social influence as a spiritual teacher? In this first of two episodes with Eckhart Tolle, we did our best to not shit our pants a little while asking him about what separates \u2018good\u2019 teachers from the scary ones, and how to cultivate an awakened state without falling down a cult rabbit hole. He\u2019s got some gems to share. After all, he\u2019s widely recognized as one of the most inspiring spiritual leaders in the world. His international bestsellers have been translated into 52 languages. And we can\u2019t verify this, but he might be one of the MOST quoted and/or misquoted contemporary spiritual gurus ever.

We caught up with Evan to talk about her journey to hell and back, how she\u2019s doing now, and why she won\u2019t ever stop blowing the whistle on complete fuckery. As a note to our listeners, and our lawyers, Mr. Manson has repeatedly denied the multiple sexual assault allegations from multiple women and is currently  suing Evan for defamation over the accusations, claiming it\u2019s all part of an elaborate organized attack. Please note that conversations like the one you\u2019re about to hear can be traumatizing for abuse survivors.

      "description": "Content Warning: Discussions of child abuse and sexual assault. Listener discretion advised. At just 24 years old, Sarah Landry found herself drawn to Hindu avatar Nithyananda\u2019s teachings like a fly to honey. Moldy, toxic honey. She quickly became an apt pupil, and then his top recruiter via a steady stream of stylized YouTube videos and camera-ready social content. But after learning that the rape and child abuse allegations dogging the organization were just too credible to simply swat away, she stepped down as its propagandist-in-chief and stepped up as one of its harshest critics. The fallout since she blew the whistle on the godman\u2019s shady ways in a series of incendiary 2019 Facebook posts and Youtube videos has been steep. (If you\u2019re labeled as a double-agent for the Vatican by loyalists of a guy who is on the lam after being charged with rape and abduction: You\u2019ve officially reached Remini-levels of cult busting.) In this episode, and the next\u2014there\u2019s just too much to cover to make it a one-parter\u2014Sarah shares what it\u2019s like to be on the other side of an army she helped build, and why she won\u2019t stop working to deplatform culty characters like Nithyananda no matter how many self-proclaimed island nations they pull out of their asses.

Just like you. We were your accountants, money managers, lawyers, executive recruiters, doctors. We owned your child\u2019s private school and sold you your brownstone. But you\u2019d never guess our secret lives, how we lived in a kind of silent terror and fervor. There were hundreds of us.\u201D  That\u2019s a snippet from Spencer Schneider\u2019s compelling and creepy AF memoir: Manhattan Cult Story: My Unbelievable True Story of Sex, Crimes, Chaos, and Survival. This isn\u2019t an ad, it\u2019s just the truth: We think you\u2019re going to want to grab yourself a copy before you hit the beach this summer. It\u2019s that much of a page turner. In this episode of A Little Bit Culty, Spencer joins us to share more about what it was like living inside the nightmarish bubble of \u2018School\u2019, the ultra-secret Manhattan organization that consumed his life for 23 years. And just in case you\u2019ve not heard of  \u2018School\u2019, this particular culty shitshow gives us Eyes Wide Shut vibes with sprinklings of Eloise if she lived at The Plaza in the Upside Down. For extra credit, read up on  the late Sharon Gans, the eccentric School leader whose cult resume lowlights include: forced adoptions, arranged marriages, twisted displays of public humiliation and  conspicuous consumption, and  forced labor.

      "description": "Sarah and Nippy watched Holy Hell closely when they were exiting NXIVM back in 2016. It hit close to home: The documentary is an intimate look at the implosion of Buddhafield, a mysterious self-help cult formed by a charismatic character with an iffy backstory. In this episode, Sarah and Nippy welcome the film\u2019s director Will Allen to talk about what it was like to shine a light on Jaime Gomez, the so-called spiritual guru at the twisted heart of the group. Will didn\u2019t just film it all: he lived it. After joining Buddhafield as a freshly-minted film school grad, it consumed his world for twenty odd years with life-altering consequences. He was looking for a sense of community and purpose, but after the love bombing phase it was far from the blissed-out communal dream it was cracked up to be.  Five years after the film\u2019s release, Will chats with Sarah and Nippy about how he\u2019s doing now; his journey from unofficial in-house cult documentarian to whistleblower; and what it takes to disrupt patterns of abuse and coercive control in new agey circles. And be warned, dear listener, that this conversation delves into the same potentially triggering content that gave rise to Holy Hell\u2019s apt title. As told in the film via multiple victims\u2019 accounts, Gomez used weekly hypnotherapy sessions to sexually abuse and exploit young male devotees, Will among them.

      "title": "Bigger Than the Pope: Jennings Brown on Teal Swan \u0026 The Fellowship of Friends (Part 1)",
      "description": "[Content Warning: This episode contains references to suicide, mental illness, and sexual assault. Listener discretion advised.] Youtube spiritual guru Teal Swan says she saves lives. Others say she\u2019s dangerously death-obsessed. We say she\u2019s serving strong \u201C9 Perfect Strangers\u201D villain vibes with a side order of night terrors. But that\u2019s just us. We wanted an expert\u2019s perspective, so we called on investigative journalist Jennings Brown for this episode to help us understand more about Teal\u2019s world. As a senior reporter at Gizmodo, Jennings traveled to rural Utah, the forests of Costa Rica, and smack dab into the middle of Teal\u2019s inner circle to understand her teachings and investigate the deaths of some of her followers.\u00A0  His unprecedented access to her group is at the heart of a six part podcast called  The Gateway - which we highly recommend as critical listening for anyone wanting to learn more about Teal\u2019s whole vibe from a safe distance. He joins us today to talk about the sharp edges woven into her carefully-curated, hypnotic image, and how spiritual hucksters are gaming the algorithm and manipulating people\u2019s most vulnerable moments. We also talk to him about his newest Spotify Original podcast series:  Revelations which follows a California cult that combines doomsday prophecies and fine wine. And TBH, we get so carried away that we go into extra innings. Enjoy this first episode with Jennings - and we\u2019ll be back next week with part two.\u00A0  Support the ALBC Pod: We\u2019ve made a link where you can support A Little Bit Culty with a one-time, weekly, or monthly contribution.

But until now, he\u2019s never publicly rocked a mic to share his own story as an ex-Jehovah\u2019s Witness. Ian joins Sarah and Nippy for a rollicking ride through the denomination\u2019s history, and his journey from born-and-raised JW and church elder, to unapologetic apostate. He has a few choice things to say about why JWs appear to be leaving the denomination in droves, as well as some memories to share about that one time a fellow voice actor by the name of Sarah Edmondson tried to recruit him into NXIVM.  About Our Guest: You may have heard Ian James Corlett in the Emmy-nominated Dinosaur Train, in CartoonNetwork\u2019s zany Johnny Test, or in the latest Disney Jr hit: Vampirina. And going further back, Ian originated the iconic English dub voice of Goku in Dragonball Z as well as voicing other 90\u2019s icons such as Megaman, and Bob in Reboot.

As a successful entrepreneur and in-demand CEO Whisperer, he\u2019s coached dozens of companies globally and is known for creating world-class company cultures. Once upon a time, he also used this talking point on the regular as part of his top-rated keynote speaking gigs: \u0022To build an amazing company, it has to be a little bit more than a business, and a little bit less than a religion, it has to be in the zone of a cult.\u0022 Cameron joins Sarah and Nippy to talk about why he no longer stans that culty line of thinking, and how corporate culture routinely blurs the lines between community and coercion.\u00A0  About Our Guest: Cameron Herold is the founder of the COO Alliance, author of 5 business books including Vivid Vision, and founder of the Invest In Your Leaders course.

      "description": "As a first year student at the University of Maryland, Lucy Taylor welcomed the sisterhood and built-in community that Greek life promised. But after accepting a bid into a \u2018top-tier\u2019 sorority, she left after seven months inside a toxic stew of rampant sexual assault, slut-shaming, misgogny, and racism. Lucy shared her experience in season one of her podcast, SNAPPED, and after an outpouring of responses she\u2019s continuing to use the series to help other former sorority and fraternity members share their all-too similar and all-too-horrific stories. On the cusp of spring, when Greek Week events and semi-formals are about to pop off on college campuses far and wide, Lucy joins Sarah and Nippy for an important conversation about the dangers of a beloved campus tradition. She shares why her experience in the panhellenic scene was hellish,\u00A0 and how the bait-and-switch recruitment tactics and gross coercive control methods that are rife throughout the Greek system are a whole bunch of culty. Before you ship your kids off to college, make sure you listen to this one.  About Lucy Taylor: Lucy Taylor is the creator, editor, producer, and host of SNAPPED, a podcast which explores the inner workings of sororities and fraternities on America\u2019s college campuses.

      "description": "A Little Bit Culty \u2013 We took zero breaks between seasons because we need you to hear this episode. Erin Robbins wasn\u2019t featured in Wild Wild Country, the 2018 Netflix Docuseries about Bhagawan Shree Rajneesh, also known as Osho. She lived it in real-time. She discovered the controversial guru\u2019s teachings at age 23 in 1977, and by the time he summoned her to his bedroom a year later for a \u2018special and secret\u2019 meeting that quickly devolved into a vile and violating encounter (the first of many) she thought he was the greatest spiritual master who\u2019d ever walked the planet. Erin disregarded her father, the co-founder, and owner of the Baskin-Robbins ice cream company, risking her family connection and inheritance in order to follow a man who would eventually lead his disciples into a world of murders, mass poisonings, and the gross sexual violation of children. After nearly 45 years of staying quiet, Erin is sharing her story after waking up just a year ago. This episode is full of potentially triggering content related to child abuse, coerced sterilization, and sexual assault. It also contains a staggering amount of bravery.

      "description": "A Little Bit Culty \u2013 If the producers of Tiger King decide to make their next true crime show about you, you\u2019ve got a helluva story. Sarma Melngailis is the woman at the heart of \u201CBad Vegan\u201D the buzzworthy Netflix docu-series that chronicles her meteoric rise to fame, and her disturbing crash and burn from celebrity chef to fugitive. It\u2019s the stuff of clickbait gold, but beyond the headlines, there\u2019s usually more to it. And Sarma\u2019s story is, you guessed it: More than a little bit culty. We don\u2019t want to spoil anything, but there\u2019s a Keith Raniere-esque player involved in this epic fail. Sarma fell under the sway of a gambler with a criminal past who slid into her Twitter DMs with shady moves straight out of the NXIVM playbook, and then she married him. Cue the alleged gaslighting, sleep deprivation, and sexual humiliation. Pro-tip: If you\u2019ve come to believe that your pit bull is on the cusp of being made immortal: you\u2019ve probably been mindfucked. Sarma\u2019s got a lot to say now that those Netflix cameras aren\u2019t rolling, and she\u2019s only speaking to us.

Eric Skwarczynski is the host and creator of the Preacher Boys podcast, which is a platform for survivors\u2019 stories and the basis of an upcoming documentary film about a deeply disturbing pattern of sexual predation and abuse claims within\u00A0 the IFB. Eric joins us to talk about blowing the whistle on the IFB, what sucks about purity culture (hint: everything), and what it will take to create a sea change among current congregants, leaders, and pastors. He also gives us the scoop on his new podcast: Figuring it Out which currently features life advice from Shaq (!!!)  Also be warned: This episode contains graphic descriptions of child abuse and other completely fucking horrifying stuff. It will disturb you, and probably make you pretty irate. It made us shakey mad and more than a little sick to our stomachs to research this thing. (What the actual fuck, IFB. Get your shit together.)

      "description": "A Little Bit Culty \u2013 Jon Atack wants to help you protect yourself from the human predators who roam among us, and believes that every bad relationship, every destructive group, and every dangerous government has a human predator at its heart. This conversation was recorded several months ago, but it feels a bit prescient now that Putin is raining hellfire on Kyiv. The author, academic, and former Operating Thetan Section V chats with Sarah and Nippy about why it seems like psychopaths are running the world, and why he still has hope that humanity can turn things around in spite of itself.  \uFEFFAbout Jon Atack: Our guest today is one of the only court-appointed expert witnesses on Scientology, and his book:  Let\u2019s Sell These People a Piece of Blue Sky, about the early history of the church, is cited by academics all over the world. Jon was a \u2018public\u2019 Scientologist for nine years, trained as a counselor, and even did the secret \u2018OT\u2019 levels, but ditched it when he discovered appalling, aggressive behavior towards members. In addition to his work podcasting as a  Scientology mythbuster\u00A0 and using his Instagram account to help educate people on overcoming things like manipulation, destructive cults, and abusive relationships, he\u2019s written several novels, including  Voodoo Child (Slight Return), inspired by the life and downfall of Jimi Hendrix. By the look of all the fair gaming sites out there, he\u2019s also a Marvel-esque villain who deeply hurts Scientology\u2019s feelie weelies. This dastardly fellow lives in a charming village near Nottingham, England where, as Voltaire advised, he cultivates his garden. Exactly what a Marvel villain would do. ~ The views and opinions expressed on A Little Bit Culty do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the podcast.

These are the vibes that Bentinho Massaro is serving. He\u2019s got all the scary charisma and shiny trappings of a culty overachiever, like thousands of social media followers, a grandiose plan to build a fully enlightened society by 2035, and he even claims to vibrate at a higher frequency than other humans. He\u2019s also already achieved a rite of passage that\u2019s becoming all too common among culty fuckwads: His name in  headlines concerning the suspicious death of one of his followers at a  Sedona retreat.  Our trio of guests in this double episode whistleblower extravaganza are coming forward to call bullshit on Bentinho\u2019s special brand of mindfuckery. Jade Alectra, Keilan McNeil, and Jacqueline Graham were pulled into his mad world, and got themselves out. But they aren\u2019t going radio silent. Oh hell no. Because they want you to know that this so-called millennial spiritual guru is less of a messiah and more of a walking, talking human Fyre Festival. In part one, Jade, Keilan, and Jacqueline share what made Bentinho seem so alluring and transformational at first, and what happened when shit started getting real.\u00A0  ~ The views and opinions expressed on A Little Bit Culty do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the podcast.

Once a devotee of TFU, Keely shares what made the YouTubey, Facebooky spiritual community sound promising at first, just how quickly it went to the Upside Down, and how she\u2019s coming back from the whole shitshow now that she\u2019s out of its grips.  Oh and just FYI, the list of what TFU officially disputes about its bad press practically writes our show notes for us: They dispute that they promote harassment and stalking. They dispute that they engage in exploitative and cult-like practices. They dispute that they coerce members into changing their gender. A Little Bit Culty, on the other hand, does not dispute that the whole TFU vibe makes us want to throw up in our mouths a little bit. Happy Freakin\u2019 Valentine\u2019s Day. ~ The views and opinions expressed on A Little Bit Culty do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the podcast.

In Part 2, he shares what happened during his last conversation with Keith Raniere, how he\u2019s defragged his brain since he helped burn ol\u2019 Dead Eyes\u2019 playhouse down, and what the bleep he\u2019s working on next. Oh, and there is bountiful ass-chapping.  More about today\u2019s guest:\u00A0 Author, speaker, and award-winning director Mark Vicente was behind the sleeper hit \u201CWhat The Bleep Do We Know?!\u201D Born in South Africa in 1965, Mark took his first photograph at age four and discovered his passion for being behind the camera. After working his way up the ranks of the camera department, his first big break came as Cinematographer on the musical \u201CSARAFINA,\u201D starring Whoopi Goldberg. In 1992, he relocated to Los Angeles to shoot his first studio picture for Disney entitled \u201CFATHERHOOD\u201D From a very young age he found himself propelled to question beliefs about the human condition. His filmmaking activism led him to make a number of films, including \u2018Encender el Corazon\u2019, about the rampant kidnapping epidemic in Mexico. It was a bittersweet victory; the film touched people deeply, but was by association supporting NXIVM.\u00A0 He made the difficult decision to pull the film from distribution and, with a small band of whistleblowers, expose their criminal enterprise.\u00A0  Mark\u2019s since developed a keen\u00A0 interest in exposing the coercive and duplicitous environments of high-control groups.

      "description": "A Little Bit Culty \u2013 If you think you\u2019re too smart to fall for a cult, this episode is your wake-up call. Undue influence can poison what starts out as a \u2018good thing\u2019 and turn it into a culty shitshow. Just ask today\u2019s guest: Gerette Buglion. She was a member of an under-the-radar cult for over 18 years. In this organization, there was no tithing, no rules about where you should live, what brand of deodorant you must use, or what clothes to wear. Instead, far more subtle techniques were used...but they were powerful, and destructive all the same. When Gerette finally emerged from the cult at age 52, she asked herself, \u201CHow did I, an educated, caring mother, wife, and business owner become that lost and for that long?\u201D She joins us to discuss her page-turning memoir, and her journey from hopeful therapy client to enthusiastic cult member to an anti-cult crusader. Spoiler alert: You\u2019re not too smart to fall for culty shit.\u00A0  More about today\u2019s guest: Gerette Buglion, B.A. Elementary Education and Special Education, earned her \u2018Master\u0027s Degree\u2019 in cult awareness education from the school of life. This training occurred during her eighteen-year odyssey with Doug (Fictitious name. Real person) who was the leader of the \u2018Center for Transformational Learning\u2019 (fictitious name for a real group, also simply CTL). Her memoir of her experience,  An Everyday Cult, lifts the nuanced veil of controlling groups through its subtle weaving of personal experience with insight from recognized cultic phenomena.

      "description": "A Little Bit Culty \u2013 Consent is one of the most misunderstood words of all time, and in the confusion surrounding it, bad actors find loopholes. According to today\u2019s guests, defining consent in penal code is key to prosecuting sex crimes and preventing sexual assaults. Joyce Short has fought to define consent for over a decade. A sexual assault survivor, she has written 3 books on the subject. Her most recent, \u0022Your Consent - The Key to Conquering Sexual Assault,\u0022 lay the foundation for New York\u0027s current bills, #A6540 and #S6200, defining \u0022consent\u0022 in penal law. She is a TEDx Talk Presenter and the Founder and Director of the Consent Awareness Network (CAN): A coalition whose mission is to correctly define consent for society and to properly define it in laws and statutes across the US and around the world. She joins the podcast today with CAN Chief of Staff and Consent Outreach Ambassador Nina Lucas to talk about bill A6540, a piece of legislation currently in committee in New York state that seeks to define consent and clarify the definition of lawful sexual conduct.  Today\u2019s episode wraps Season One of A Little Bit Culty with the opposite of word salad around the issue of consent, followed by a clear call to action: Spread the word about #FGKIA, help bill A6540 get out of committee, and help define consent.\u00A0 Learn more at: Assembly Bill A6540   Sign The Petition Consent Awareness Network Joyce\u2019s TedTalk Joyce\u2019s Book  Follow Joyce on Instagram\u00A0  Follow Nina on TikTok  Follow Nina on Instagram  Don\u2019t get it twisted: The views and opinions expressed on A Little Bit Culty do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the podcast.

      "description": "A Little Bit Culty \u2013 Daniel Shaw, LCSW, checks every imaginable box on A Little Bit Culty\u2019s dream guest checklist. He\u2019s a psychoanalyst in private practice in New York City and in Nyack, New York. He originally trained as an actor at Northwestern University and with the renowned teacher Uta Hagen in New York City, and later worked as a missionary for an Indian guru. His eventual recognition of cultic aspects of this organization led him to become an outspoken activist in support of individuals and families traumatically abused in cults. Simultaneous with leaving this group, Dan began his training in the mental health profession, becoming a faculty member and supervisor at the National Institute for the Psychotherapist in New York. His book, Traumatic Narcissism: Relational Systems of Subjugation, was published by Routledge in 2014 and was nominated for the distinguished Gradiva Award.  In 2018, the International Cultic Studies Association awarded him the Margaret Thaler Singer Award for advancing the understanding of coercive persuasion and undue influence. Shaw\u2019s book Traumatic Narcissism and Recovery: Leaving the Prison of Shame and Fear will be published by Routledge in 2021. Dan joined Sarah and Nippy to share his story, drop some knowledge about the shameless ways of traumatizing narcissists, and provide insights on the recovery process.

And if by chance you wake up to what\u0027s inherently terrible about it, and manage to escape that thinking, how do you then seek redemption? In 2017, Samantha Freedom was the top ranking woman leader in Identity Evropa, the white nationalist organization behind the violent Charlottesville, Virginia \u2018Unite the Right\u2019 rally that resulted in the death of 20 year old Heather Heyer. That event was when Samantha\u2019s descent into white supremacy, something she\u2019s described as a \u2018fever dream,\u2019 finally began to break. Samantha joins Sarah and Nippy for a frank and sometimes painful conversation about her journey in and out of the alt-right, and why she\u2019s nowhere near done when it comes to making things right.

With so much happening at rapidfire pace in the culti-verse, A Little Bit Culty lit up the Bat signal and Matthew Remski of the Conspirituality podcast answered. He\u2019s an author, an investigative journalist, and a dad who also happens to be a two-time survivor of yoga-related cults. And if you know the Conspirituality podcast, you know that he and his co-hosts offer a weekly master class on a whole venn diagram of cults, conspiracy theories, new age charlatans, and the darkest fringes of the spiritual marketplace.\u00A0  Matthew joins Sarah and Nippy for an episode that delves into his journey from cult survivor to expert, and his advice for navigating the strange position of doing cult recovery on the world stage. They also cover cultic abuse in the digital age, toxic Kundalini gurus, and why it\u2019s high time for a few phrases related to cult discourse to be updated for 2021.

Douglas Brooks, an attorney who represents victims of deceptive schemes, knows that getting caught up in one can be devastating. For the better part of 3 decades, he\u2019s dedicated a significant portion of his practice to representing the victims of deceptive MLM schemes, including cases such as Webster v. Omnitrition International, Rhodes v. Consumers\u0027 Buyline, Inc., and Jacobs v. Herbalife International. He\u2019s interviewed or deposed hundreds of participants in MLM schemes, reviewed tens of thousands of documents which were produced by MLM firms subject to confidentiality orders, and studied the compensation plans of scores of MLM companies.\u00A0 Which is basically to say: He knows his shit.  He\u2019s also worked pro bono for a number of non-profit organizations involved in the effort to educate and protect consumers from deceptive and fraudulent MLM schemes, including Pyramid Scheme Alert (www.pyramidschemealert.org), the Consumer Awareness Institute (www.MLM-thetruth.com),\u00A0 In this episode, Sarah, Nippy, and Doug do a deep dive on all things MLMs and pyramid schemes - and Sarah shares her pre-NXIVM experience with an MLM organization that nearly destroyed a close friendship.They also cover why Nippy won\u2019t be coming to your essential oils class anytime soon.

But if you don\u2019t know her story, just know this: She was way ahead of the curve on calling bullshit Keith Raniere and his flying monkeys. She also paid dearly for it.\u00A0 In this episode, Sarah and Nippy reconnect with Susan to talk in-depth about her role as one of the original \u201CNXIVM 9,\u201D what her healing process looks like these days, and why she torched her proctor sashes. They cover the joy in seeing justice served, the murky cross-border dealings of Keith\u2019s inner circle, and Susan spills some surprising tea with a few revelations for Sarah and Nippy.

      "description": "A Little Bit Culty \u2013 Dr. Janja Lalich\u2019s book about the cult recovery process was a game changer for Sarah and Nippy when they first began unpacking their NXIVM experiences. It still is. As Nippy says: \u201CShe\u0027s someone who has been through (her own) heavy duty cult indoctrination, woken up, gotten her way out. She\u0027s kept on going. She\u0027s dedicated her life to helping other people understand how cults operate and how to come back from them.\u201D In this episode, Sarah and Nippy reconnect with Dr. Lalich for a conversation about her journey from cult member to author-expert, and her insights on NXIVM\u2019s now incarcerated founder, Keth Raniere. They also explore what leads people into abusive dynamics, what can pull them back in, and tools for getting back on track.\u00A0 About Dr. Lalich: Janja Lalich, Ph.D. is a researcher, author, and educator specializing in cults and extremist groups, with a particular focus on charismatic relationships, political and other social movements, ideology and social control, and issues of gender and sexuality.

But when he escaped the organization in 2007, he cut his losses; leaving with only a briefcase and the clothes on his back.

      "description": "A Little Bit Culty \u2013 What\u2019s the difference between a cult and something that\u2019s just a little bit culty? What should Sarah and Nippy tell their kids when they\u2019re old enough to ask about NXIVM? How do you protect yourself from mind control? On this episode of A Little Bit Culty, our co-hosts chat with cult expert and author Dr. Steven Hassan about what makes people universally vulnerable to undue influence and cultic abuse; how to spot red flags; and some of the striking similarities between Keith Raniere and Donald Trump. They also explore Dr. Hassan\u2019s cult origin story as a former member of the Moon cult, as well as his groundbreaking BITE Model that demystifies the methods that cults deploy to recruit and maintain control over people. Sarah also shares a (ahem) juicy story about a WTF moment of truth about a certain dietary mystery among the women of NXIVM that always perplexed her.  About Dr. Steven Hassan: As one of the world\u2019s leading authorities on cults, Dr. Steven Hassan has been helping people wake up, leave, and heal from cultic abuse for over forty years as a mental health professional, consultant, and educator. He is the founding director of the Freedom of Mind Resource Center, an organization that specializes in providing acute intensive care for people exiting destructive environments. Dr. Hassan is also the author of four books, including Combating Cult Mind Control, Freedom of Mind, and most recently: The Cult of Trump. About the BITE Model, as quoted from the Freedom of Mind Resource center site at Freedomofmind.com: \u201CBased on research and theory by Robert Jay Lifton, Margaret Singer, Edgar Schein, Louis Jolyon West, and others who studied brainwashing in  Maoist China as well as cognitive dissonance theory by Leon Festinger, Steven Hassan developed the BITE Model to describe the specific methods that cults use to recruit and maintain control over people.\u00A0\u201CBITE\u201D stands for Behavior, Information, Thought, and Emotional control.

The pair share the story of how the A Little Bit Culty podcast came to be, and state some intentions and ground rules up front. Namely, as co-hosts of the podcast, they don\u2019t want to be in the business of punching down on people who are still in cults. They also state their mission to be as responsible as possible with the platform, and to help other people by having the honest, informed conversations they wish they\u2019d heard when they were in NXIVM.\u00A0  Sarah and Nippy also discuss how the experience of leaving NXIVM has affected their relationship and their outlook now: especially in the aftermath of Keith Raniere\u2019s conviction and 120 year prison sentence. They also tackle some burning questions from people who\u2019ve followed their story closely: Did Keith ever hit on Sarah? Where did Nippy get his name? Are you still friends with anyone from NXIVM, and do you ever want to talk to Lauren or Nancy again? Then they wrap it all up by sharing a few of the less headline-worthy things that really chapped their ass about NXIVM: from the organization\u2019s flying monkeys and fixers, to\u00A0 office politics and full-on interoffice polyamory.
