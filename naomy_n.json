      "description": "I was going through some of the testimonies coming from Shakahola. As the trial of Paul Mackenzie and others continue, I figured we could go through some stories. (Testimonies  from survivors, victim families who were interviewed by media)\n\nHopefully justice will be served because I\u0027m guessing we do not want to live in a world where over 400 people can die and nobody is held accountable because that is just scary.\n\n(Filmed this over a month ago, was really nervous about posting)",
