      "description": "When Steven Hassan was 19 years old, he was recruited by the Unification Church, an infamous cult know for its mass marriage ceremonies. He spent two and a half years with the group, working to bring in new members, raise money, and preach the teachings of its controversial founder, Sun Myung Moon\u2014until a near-fatal car accident helped him realize he\u2019d been brainwashed, and led him to flee the cult. After the World Peace and Unification Sanctuary\u2014an offshoot of the Unification Church\u2014nabbed international headlines for holding a blessing ceremony complete with AR-15s and bullet crowns earlier this year, we met up with Hassan to hear more about his time as a \u201CMoonie,\u201D find out how he escaped, and learn why he\u2019s since dedicated his life to becoming an expert on cults.\n\nWATCH NEXT: Inside the Church of the AR-15 -- https://youtu.be/ArfGyo6HQ_E\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-Videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo\nClick here to get the best of VICE daily: http://bit.ly/1SquZ6v\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/vice\nDownload VICE on iOS: http://apple.co/28Vgmqz\nDownload VICE on Android: http://bit.ly/28S8Et0",
