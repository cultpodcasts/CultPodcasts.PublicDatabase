      "description": "The Church of Scientology is well known for its celebrity following and the intergalactic warrior lord Xenu \u2013 who you can only learn about after climbing a paywall of courses worth many thousands of dollars. But who you don\u2019t often hear from are the employees of the Church, who can be forced to work incredibly long hours for a tiny wage. \n\nIn this episode of Informer, we speak to a former employee of the Church of Scientology, who was pressured into signing a work contract, had his passport taken off him, and regularly worked 80 hour weeks to earn under \u00A35,000 a year. \n\nWatch more like this: \n\nHow a Sex Party Actually Works\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0PDEN7iDdo\u0026t=198s\n\nI Clean Up After Murders, Meth Labs \u0026 Serial Killers\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5XjEH5ukp0\u0026t=1s\n\nHow I Stole $300 Million in Rare Diamonds\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85EROW8QBh8\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nAbout VICE:\nThe Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

      "description": "When Steven Hassan was 19 years old, he was recruited by the Unification Church, an infamous cult know for its mass marriage ceremonies. He spent two and a half years with the group, working to bring in new members, raise money, and preach the teachings of its controversial founder, Sun Myung Moon\u2014until a near-fatal car accident helped him realize he\u2019d been brainwashed, and led him to flee the cult. After the World Peace and Unification Sanctuary\u2014an offshoot of the Unification Church\u2014nabbed international headlines for holding a blessing ceremony complete with AR-15s and bullet crowns earlier this year, we met up with Hassan to hear more about his time as a \u201CMoonie,\u201D find out how he escaped, and learn why he\u2019s since dedicated his life to becoming an expert on cults.\n\nWATCH NEXT: Inside the Church of the AR-15 -- https://youtu.be/ArfGyo6HQ_E\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-Videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo\nClick here to get the best of VICE daily: http://bit.ly/1SquZ6v\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/vice\nDownload VICE on iOS: http://apple.co/28Vgmqz\nDownload VICE on Android: http://bit.ly/28S8Et0",
