Fundamentalism is a mindset or an approach to an ideology and can happen in any social group. This episode will specifically examine the needs that fundamentalist Christianity provides for people, and the lengths people will go to protect the emotional high they get from its teachings and approach. The psychological underpinnings of fundamentalism, focus on the black and white/ us vs them mindset, authoritarianism, anti-intellectualism, justification of evil, narcissism, and claim of absolute truth.Join the discussion group HERE https://www.facebook.com/groups/1153866318625322/Connect with Camille K.

      "description": "TRIGGER WARNING (Suicide, Abuse)Hello, I\u2019m your host Andrew Pledger and this is \u0022Surviving Bob Jones University: A Christian Cult.\u0022I grew up in fundamentalist Christianity, specifically the Independent Fundamental Baptist cult. I was homeschooled my entire life to be indoctrinated into this environment. I was subjected to psychological, spiritual, and emotional abuse. I experienced religious trauma from abusive theology on hell, the end times, purity culture, sexuality, and human nature. As a queer person, I experienced so much trauma from their hateful and violent speech towards the LGBTQ\u002B community and also harm from authoritarian parents. Fundamentalist Christianity was my whole world and I ended up at Bob Jones University. I was at BJU for 3.5 years from 2018-2021. While at Bob Jones I struggled with my mental health from religious trauma, sexual repression, and minority stress. I was driven to the point of nearly committing suicide from my traumas in this system of control. I knew I could not get the help I needed in this environment so I searched outside the group. I was able to connect with people on the outside who would eventually get me out of this cult.\u00A0Series coming in 2023.Music Credit: https://www.purple-planet.comConnect with Andrew PledgerMental Health ResourcesNational Suicide Hotline (988)Trevor Project HotlineCDC ResourcesFind a Therapist (Psychology Today) Hosted on Acast.
