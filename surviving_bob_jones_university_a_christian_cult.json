Drawing from the renowned works of cult expert Steven Hassan\u0027s BITE model and psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton\u0027s Criteria for Thought Reform, we unravel the complex dynamics at play within this institution.We meticulously examine the various elements of the BITE model, including behavior control, information control, thought control, and emotional control, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the institution\u0027s influence and power dynamics. We delve into the ways in which Bob Jones University exhibits traits identified in Lifton\u0027s Criteria for Thought Reform.Connect with Andrew PledgerSocial Media: https://andrewpledger.mypixieset.com/linksJoin my Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/4ndrewpledgerSources: https://www.tumblr.com/survivingbjupodcast/726104816669081600/sources?source=share Hosted on Acast.

We talk about the ways women are pressured, objectified, and criticized for their appearance, and how they are indoctrinated to obey male leadership. We also reveal how representatives of the school mistreated and blamed sexual abuse survivors, and how an outside organization called GRACE (Godly Response to Abuse in the Christian Environment) investigated and published a report that exposed the school\u0027s mishandling of sexual abuse claims. One of the survivors, Erin Burchwell, tells us her story of the trauma she endured, and how the school treated her when she came forward to be interviewed for the GRACE Report.Leave a 5-star rating on Apple Podcasts and SpotifyConnect with Andrew PledgerSocial Media: https://andrewpledger.mypixieset.com/linksJoin my Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/4ndrewpledgerSpeaking Up Podcast: https://shows.acast.com/speaking-up-with-andrew-pledgerSources: https://www.tumblr.com/survivingbjupodcast/726104816669081600/sources?source=share Hosted on Acast.

      "description": "TRIGGER WARNING (Suicide, Abuse)Hello, I\u2019m your host Andrew Pledger and this is \u0022Surviving Bob Jones University: A Christian Cult.\u0022I grew up in fundamentalist Christianity, specifically the Independent Fundamental Baptist cult. I was homeschooled my entire life to be indoctrinated into this environment. I was subjected to psychological, spiritual, and emotional abuse. I experienced religious trauma from abusive theology on hell, the end times, purity culture, sexuality, and human nature. As a queer person, I experienced so much trauma from their hateful and violent speech towards the LGBTQ\u002B community and also harm from authoritarian parents. Fundamentalist Christianity was my whole world and I ended up at Bob Jones University. I was at BJU for 3.5 years from 2018-2021. While at Bob Jones I struggled with my mental health from religious trauma, sexual repression, and minority stress. I was driven to the point of nearly committing suicide from my traumas in this system of control. I knew I could not get the help I needed in this environment so I searched outside the group. I was able to connect with people on the outside who would eventually get me out of this cult.\u00A0Series coming in 2023.Music Credit: https://www.purple-planet.comConnect with Andrew PledgerMental Health ResourcesNational Suicide Hotline (988)Trevor Project HotlineCDC ResourcesFind a Therapist (Psychology Today) Hosted on Acast.
