      "description": "In this video, I sit down with Licensed Therapist, Juliet Rowsey, to discuss the risks of coaches who claim to be able to heal trauma and mental health. As the popularity of life coaching grows, so do cases of unqualified coaches stepping into roles they\u2019re simply not trained for. We discuss the red flags to watch out for, why mental health support must be left to licensed professionals, and the impact on individuals who have unknowingly sought \u201Ctherapy\u201D from life coaches outside their scope.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever been unsure about a coach\u2019s qualifications or feel frustrated with the coaching industry\u2019s blurred lines, this conversation is for you. Remember, real mental health support comes from real professionals.\n\n#pyramidscheme #coachingscam #traumacoach \n\nSUBMIT REACTION CONTENT: https://forms.gle/93GKQTQisRLooQbRA\nSUBMIT YOUR SCAM STORY: https://forms.gle/aawVohdLDTNfcNc48\n\n\uD83D\uDCA1 SUBSCRIBE FOR MORE\uD83D\uDCA1\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTsSi3AJ7CPi0v8lghhRR3g?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\u2B07\uFE0F Join My Membership \u2B07\uFE0F\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTsSi3AJ7CPi0v8lghhRR3g/join\n\nBinge My Coaching Scam Content: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxwgv-UHeOWtkKiBH45hluL8ume-sxjkc\n\n\u25AC VIDEO CONTENTS \u25AC\n00:00 - Intro\n01:05 - Interview Starts\n03:59 - Coaches Working Outside of Scope\n06:46 - Trauma Informed Practice\n08:54 - What Makes Clients Vulnerable\n11:27 - Dealing with Blurred Boundaries\n13:24 - Where is the Balance?\n17:13 - Red Flags to Look Out For\n21:00 - How Coaches \u0026 Therapists Can Work Toogether\n22:49 - Which to Choose\n29:02 - Finding the Right Fit\n31:39 - Final Warnings\n\n---\n\uD83D\uDCF2 LET\u0027S CONNECT\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/itsdanielleryan\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@itsdanielleryan\nWebsite: https://danielleryan.me\n\n\uD83D\uDCE7 EMAIL ME: hello@danielleryan.me\n\n\u2615 BUY ME A COFFEE: https://ko-fi.com/itsdanielleryan\n\n\uD83D\uDECD\uFE0F CHECK OUT MY AMAZON AFFILIATE STOREFRONT: \n\uD83C\uDDE8\uD83C\uDDE6 https://www.amazon.ca/shop/itsdanielleryan\n\uD83C\uDDFA\uD83C\uDDF8 https://www.amazon.com/shop/itsdanielleryan\n---\nSection 29 of the Copyright Act of Canada States:\n(29) Fair dealing for the purpose of research, private study, education, parody or satire does not infringe copyright.\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe content in this video is meant for entertainment purposes \u0026 all opinions shared are my own.

What began as an innocent attempt to start a journey to self-improvement quickly spiralled into an inability to keep touch with reality. Listen as the viewer details the heartbreaking experience of losing her mother to the pseudoscientific manifestation believers with little hope of resolution. \n\n#pyramidscheme #coachingscam #manifestation \n\nSUBMIT REACTION CONTENT: https://forms.gle/93GKQTQisRLooQbRA\nSUBMIT YOUR SCAM STORY: https://forms.gle/aawVohdLDTNfcNc48\n\n\uD83D\uDCA1 SUBSCRIBE FOR MORE\uD83D\uDCA1\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTsSi3AJ7CPi0v8lghhRR3g?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\u2B07\uFE0F Join My Membership \u2B07\uFE0F\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTsSi3AJ7CPi0v8lghhRR3g/join\n\nBinge My Coaching Scam Content: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxwgv-UHeOWtkKiBH45hluL8ume-sxjkc\n\n---\n\uD83D\uDCF2 LET\u0027S CONNECT\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/itsdanielleryan\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@itsdanielleryan\nWebsite: https://danielleryan.me\n\n\uD83D\uDCE7 EMAIL ME: hello@danielleryan.me\n\n\u2615 BUY ME A COFFEE: https://ko-fi.com/itsdanielleryan\n\n\uD83D\uDECD\uFE0F CHECK OUT MY AMAZON AFFILIATE STOREFRONT: \n\uD83C\uDDE8\uD83C\uDDE6 https://www.amazon.ca/shop/itsdanielleryan\n\uD83C\uDDFA\uD83C\uDDF8 https://www.amazon.com/shop/itsdanielleryan\n---\nSection 29 of the Copyright Act of Canada States:\n(29) Fair dealing for the purpose of research, private study, education, parody or satire does not infringe copyright.\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe content in this video is meant for entertainment purposes \u0026 all opinions shared are my own.
