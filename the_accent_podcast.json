We discussed Alien life, Interstellar objects visiting the Earth (Oumuamua), the limitation of the multiverse, time travel, and A.I. astronauts. We also discussed Dr. Loeb\u2019s exploration projects, including Galileo Project and Starshot initiative that is working on a technology that would allow sending probes to Alpha Centauri and reach it within our lifetimes.
