      "description": "Dana studied journalism and psychology at DePaul University. While there\u2019s no better teacher than life experience and Dana has had life-long experiences with narcissistic abuse, her education did give her the ability to accurately verbalize and express how narcissistic abuse creates confusion and conflict within victims.\n\nToday, Dana is a proud voice for fellow victims who are unable, afraid, or ashamed to share their experiences. She strives to create awareness and understanding to ensure victims are given the support they need to first understand their situation and then begin the healing process. Her first book, chronicling her own abusive marriage that lasted nearly three decades, started as a journal that she hid under the couch cushion in the basement.\n\nDana\u0027s contact details:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/danasdiazauthor/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/danas.diaz/\nDana\u0027s book:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Gasping-Air-Stranglehold-Narcissistic-Abuse/dp/B0C6WBCWNG/\n\nFollow me for more content here:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100095156184970\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisatickel/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/lisamtickel/\nWebsite: https://healingandgrowinghandinhandpodcast.com/",
