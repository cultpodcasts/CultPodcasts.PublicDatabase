They talk about their motivations to cover a secret cult, the mixed experiences with the group\u0027s members, and the necessity of presenting multiple sides of the story rather than demonizing a particular group. The discussion also touches on the importance of faith in society and the challenges in leaving a group one has been with their whole life.
