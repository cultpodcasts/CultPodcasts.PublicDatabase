      "description": "American democracy is hanging on by a thread. But how did we get here? Today\u0027s episode offers an insider\u0027s peek into Christian nationalism. You may remember Nikki G from Ep.77; she was on the pod back in January, sharing about her work as a Certified Trauma Recovery Coach who specializes in spiritual and religious abuse. In early March, Candice invited her to sit down again for this two-part conversation. Nikki is a former devotee in the evangelical movement whose passion at the time was \u0022governmental intercession.\u0022 In Part 1 of this dialogue, she peels back the curtain on the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) Movement and how its decades-long perversion of Christianity has infiltrated US politics. Nikki lays out the bones of the movement\u0027s history and gives us a feel for what it\u2019s like inside NAR\u0027s apostolic hubs, all working in coordination toward the same end-game. She walks us through Lance Wallnau\u2019s 7 Mountain Mandate, a strategic plan to impose religious order on the masses and shamelessly colonize every aspect of American culture. Nikki tells us what it was like, watching evangelical leaders embrace Trump prior to the first election; then she and Candice discuss why he\u2019s actually the ideal point man for the movement. This episode lays a critical foundation for the Heritage Foundation\u0027s far-right playbook (Project 2025) and where this conversation will be headed next week, in Part 2. Nikki G. is a Certified Trauma Recovery Coach who helps survivors recover and thrive after Religious Trauma \u0026 Cult involvement. She is also survivor of multiple narcissistic relationships, religious trauma, and several cultic communities. Nikki is the CEO of Nikki G Speaks LLC, which provides survivors with individual coaching, online community, and psychoeducation related to religious trauma, narcissistic abuse, and cult involvement. Nikki is a co-host of the podcast \u201CSurviving the Black Church\u201D where she and her co-hosts delve into conversations regarding religious trauma in the Black Church. She is also the co-founder of The Black Religious Trauma Recovery Network and she sits on the board of directors for Tears of Eden, a non-profit organization that supports survivors who have experienced abuse in the evangelical community. nikkigspeaks.com | @nikki_g_speaks Referenced In This Episode: God \u0026 Country - documentary Power Worshippers, by Katherine Stewart Conspirituality Episode #187 - Project 2025 Mindshift Podcast - Exposing Project 2025 Support the Show.

      "description": "January is Spiritual Abuse Awareness Month, and this week Candice welcomes a very special guest. Nikki G is a Certified Trauma Recovery Coach, co-host of the Surviving The Black Church\u00A0podcast, and a vocal advocate for spiritual and religious abuse survivors. Nikki shares briefly about her personal history growing up in a narcissistic family system, time spent in five different cults, and her personal path of healing. She speaks about the subtle yet sometimes critical difference between spiritual and religious trauma, then offers guidance around how best to seek support and healing. Nikki generously walks us through a brief history of The Black Church, speaking to how intergenerational trauma must be a consideration when supporting Black folks who are recovering from spiritual and religious abuse. The term \u2018church hurt\u2019 is discussed; specifically how in Black Communities, when applied too broadly, it leads to the glorification of suffering and implicitly encourages abuse survivors to stay-put and endure. Candice shares suffer-in-silence parallels in the wellness world, and the two discuss how even though the gaslighting shows up differently, it ultimately results in a similar outcome - spiritual bypassing and a disconnection from self. Nikki speaks to the many invisible wounds folks grapple with upon exiting a high-demand religion or spiritual community and then describes what post-cult \u2018rehab\u2019 might look like. She shares how coming home to her body has been so pivotal in her healing process; and Candice asks for Nikki\u2019s input on the unique challenge of healing from trauma that occurs within the space of an embodiment practice. The episode wraps with a teaser into another upcoming convo with Nikki that will be recorded later this month, focusing on how religious ideologies have been systematically shaping American politics for decades. This is a rich conversation; be sure to listen to the end!Nikki G. is a Certified Trauma Recovery Coach\u00A0 who helps survivors recover and thrive after Religious Trauma \u0026 Cult involvement.
