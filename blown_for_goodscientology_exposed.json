      "description": "Roll up the curtains as we journey behind the scenes of Scientology\u0027s unique film production with industry insiders Marc Headley and Mitch Brisker. Marc brings a wealth of experience from his 15-year stint at Golden Air Productions, while Mitch, a professional director, sprinkles in his creativity and unique perspective. Together, they shed light on Scientology\u0027s global audio-visual distribution, the fluctuating crew numbers, and the fascinating details of creating the film TR-8 - Start, Change, \u0026 Stop. Buckle up, as we embark on a fascinating tour of Golden Era Productions, shaped by L. Ron Hubbard\u0027s script and the undeniably charismatic actor Geoffrey Lewis.\n\nThe second act of our journey navigates through the dramatic twists of Scientology\u0027s film production. Remember the chaos when L. Ron Hubbard ordered a halt to Scientology conventions and events, only for David Miscavige to revive them? Marc and Mitch relive those days, sharing the struggle of juggling events and film production and how Scientology Media Productions ultimately came to the rescue. They also delve into the peculiarities of their studio - think Tom Sawyer-inspired men\u0027s room, an Egyptian-style makeup room, and a princess-themed women\u0027s bathroom. It\u0027s not your typical studio, right?\n\nAs we draw the curtain on our behind-the-scenes tour, Marc and Mitch recall the food challenges on the set of TR8, Start, Change, Stop - late deliveries, lack of quality, and a dollar-a-day food allowance. They also discuss the technical and costume issues that arose during filming and share their experiences of working under the demanding and intricate orders of L. Ron Hubbard. What was it like to shoot a film under such conditions, you ask? Tune in and find out everything about the unwritten and unseen stories that shape Scientology\u0027s film production.

That\u0027s the painful reality for our guest Sterling Tompkins, who joins us in this stirring episode to discuss the puzzling case of Shelly Miscavige, the wife of the Scientology leader, David Miscavige. Shelly, once an ever-present figure, who has been conspicuously absent from public view since 2005, stirring a whirlpool of questions and theories. Sterling, Shelly\u0027s brother-in-law and nephew, lends a unique perspective to our conversation as we traverse the complex family dynamics and the enigma encircling Shelly\u0027s absence.\n\nThis isn\u0027t just a chat about a disappearance; it\u0027s a deep dive into the intricacies of our shared experiences within the Church of Scientology. We reminisce about our respective families, our upbringing within the institution, and the strains on our relationships triggered by David Miscavige\u0027s influence. We recall the memories of Shelly and David and how the aftermath of Lisa McPherson\u0027s wrongful death in 1995 marked a significant turn in their relationship.\n\nBut our chat doesn\u0027t end there. We take a moment to reflect on the present and the future - how our past experiences have molded us, and the importance of recognizing those who\u0027ve managed to do good despite the Church\u0027s practices. We open the floor to our audience, inviting you to engage with us in our ongoing conversation about our experiences and the different perspectives they bring. Join us, as we continue to untangle this complex narrative and illuminate the darker corners of our shared history.\n\nSubscribe to Sterling\u0027s channel here:\nhttps://youtube.com/@leavingscientologylovinglife\n\nBFG Store now Live!  https://blownforgood-shop.fourthwall.com\nBlown For Good Website: http://blownforgood.com/\n\nPODCAST INFO:\nPodcast website: https://www.buzzsprout.com/2131160/share\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/blown-for-good-behind-the-iron-curtain-of-scientology/id1671284503\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6NZGCcRjr8jQRFrqugdfJK\nRSS: https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/2131160.rss\n\nYOUTUBE PLAYLISTS:\nSpy Files: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq4cA-eBNXD1q9jD729pQmWk\n\nScientology Stories: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq5G35lu2nxviwc_XueI_Xmk\n\nOUTLINE:\n0:02 - Intro\n7:13 - Family Relationships and Connections\n16:37 - Memories and Relationships With Shelley\n25:51 - Parental Involvement\u0027s Impact on Childhood\n33:08 - Memories of Shelley and David\n44:31 - Future Conversations and Story Comparisons\n\n\nWant to support the BFG Channel?

Thanks and sorry for the inconvenience. \n\n\nUncover the murky mysteries of Scientology with me and my  friend, Bruce Hines, as we delve into a chilling tale of disappearance and conjecture. Can you imagine what it\u0027s like to disappear from the face of the earth? Shelly Miscavige, wife of Scientology leader David Miscavige, did just that and has been missing for 18 years. Bruce, who knew and worked with Shelly, shares his personal insights and experiences, offering a rare look into the lives of David and Shelly Miscavige within the confines of the Scientology headquarters.\n\nJourney back with us to our time living at the International Base 8, a place infused with the aroma of garlic fields and the haunting echoes of tragic losses.

      "description": "Prepare yourself for a voyage into Scientology\u0027s stormy seas as my guest, Hana Eltringham Whitfield, and I share our intense experiences from our time in the Sea Organization. Imagine being tasked with the impossible - securing a new home for 300 students and staff in Alicante, all on a Saturday night. We recount these moments of chaos, the high-stakes interactions with a local cab driver, and our triumph amidst turmoil when we finally secured a building.\n\nSet sail with us as we revisit the turbulent journey from Valencia onboard the Avon River. It wasn\u0027t smooth sailing, to say the least. As I took over the helm, we battled unpredictable weather, avoided troll boats, and bore witness to L. Ron Hubbard\u0027s unforgettable domestic disputes - broadcasted via bullhorn for the entire ship to hear. Our expedition was fraught with danger but also tinged with the scent of adventure and freedom.\n\nNow, brace for impact as we expose the chilling underbelly of Scientology\u0027s manipulation tactics. Listen closely as Leon and Amos, two of our fellow Sea Org members, recount their covert mission to Tunisia. Their task? To secure the release of Mrs. Vicky Livingston from airport security using nothing but an elaborate cover story and a symbolic red silk rosette. Their chilling success offers a window into the disturbing ways Scientology manipulates government officials and police forces, a practice still in effect today. Buckle up for an emotional whirlwind as we unpack these real-life adventures and chilling tales from the enigmatic world of Scientology.

Brace yourselves for a deeply engaging conversation with Katherine Spallino, the author of \u0027The Bad Cadet\u0027, as we unpack her intimate journey of growing up in, and ultimately escaping from, the confines of the Scientology Cadet Organization. Hear directly from Katherine herself about the indoctrination she experienced from a young age, her hard-fought journey to reclaim her freedom and the resilience it took to navigate the often tumultuous waters of familial relationships within the organization.\n\nThis isn\u0027t just about the captivating narrative of one woman\u0027s escape from a high-control organization - it\u0027s also about the transformative power of language and the potent role it plays in healing. We\u0027ll explore Katherine\u0027s writing process, the invaluable support she received, and the parallels drawn between Scientology\u0027s control mechanisms and George Orwell\u0027s dystopian novel, \u00271984\u0027. Is there something to be gleaned from resources like Victor Frankl\u0027s \u0027Man\u0027s Search for Meaning\u0027 and Tara Westover\u0027s \u0027Educated\u0027? Stick with us to find out.\n\nFinally, we\u0027ll delve into the significant role of platforms like YouTube in amplifying stories that often elude mainstream media. Hear how sharing her personal experiences became a therapeutic process for Katherine and how connections outside of Scientology can serve as lifelines for those still inside. From the depths of the challenges to the peaks of gratitude for the support and validation she received throughout her journey, Katherine\u0027s story is one you won\u0027t want to miss.\n\nKatherine\u0027s book:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Bad-Cadet-Growing-Scientologys-Organization-ebook/dp/B0C1TCQ1KQ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1W8ACLHPOIKW2\u0026keywords=bad\u002Bcadet\u0026qid=1691520563\u0026sprefix=bad\u002Bcadet%2Caps%2C150\u0026sr=8-1\n\nKatherine\u0027s YouTube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@thebadcadet\n\nBFG Store now Live!  https://blownforgood-shop.fourthwall.com\nBlown For Good Website: http://blownforgood.com/\n\nPODCAST INFO:\nPodcast website: https://www.buzzsprout.com/2131160/share\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/blown-for-good-behind-the-iron-curtain-of-scientology/id1671284503\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6NZGCcRjr8jQRFrqugdfJK\nRSS: https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/2131160.rss\n\nYOUTUBE PLAYLISTS:\nSpy Files: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq4cA-eBNXD1q9jD729pQmWk\n\nScientology Stories: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq5G35lu2nxviwc_XueI_Xmk\n\n\nOUTLINE:\n\n00.00:14 - Scientology Experiences With Katherine Spallino\n00:11:59 - Leaving Scientology, Gaining Perspective\n00:15:13 - Comparing Literature to Scientology\n19:53 - Discussion on Scientology and Writing Process\n21:23 - Discussion on Scientology and Writing Process\n29:44 - Escaping Scientology and Reclaiming Freedom\n41:03 - Reconnecting With Family Outside of Scientology\n52:59 - Author\u0027s Gratitude for Support and Validation\n\n\nSupport the Channel: \n\nPaypal Link - No Paypal account needed\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=7ZXJBQVYP4WXS\n\n\nThinking of buying a Tesla?

Her tale unfolds from a unique encounter with the organization in the early 90s, our shared memories at the Celebrity Center, and the shocking conversations that followed my initiation into the Sea Organization. The path is fraught with revelations as Cindy peels back the layers of her time within the organization, the eerie call to the ethics office, her ascent through the OT Levels, and the heartbreaking declaration of her friend\u0027s brother-in-law as a suppressive person.\n\nOur heartfelt conversation takes a tender turn as we ponder upon the concept of chosen family and the excruciating pain of disconnection that Scientology imposes. We cherish the beautiful times we had together, even as we navigate the sinister aspects of Cindy\u0027s experience - the surveillance, the financial burden, and the risks associated with aligning with this organization. But don\u0027t think for a minute that it\u0027s all doom and gloom. There are chuckles to be had, particularly when we touch upon the importance of having a will in place, a topic that takes an unexpected, humorous detour.\n\nFinally, we lighten the mood as Cindy brings us into the warmth of her kitchen with her new venture, CiCi\u0027s Comfort Cooking. It\u0027s a delightful end to a conversation that spans decades, numerous challenges, and the kind of friendship that withstands the test of time and trials.

Our guest today, Liz Ferris, embarks on a journey to answer these very questions. Walk with us as Liz peels back the layers of her story, recounting her childhood within the organization, the severance of ties with her father, Bob Ferris, her tumultuous coming-out experience, and the uncomfortable truth about Scientology\u0027s stance on love and personal relationships.\n\nIn a world where you never compare notes about experiences, Liz\u0027s narrative is a beacon of hope and strength. Through the ups and downs of her quest for her long-lost father, Liz chronicles everything - from the crushing defeat of leaving the Scientology compound, to the unwavering support she finds in her friend Vanessa and her partner. We traverse through the labyrinth of family issues, restraining orders, and the uncanny similarities to North Korea, all while emphasizing the significance of having a mandatory reporter by your side.\n\nAs Liz\u0027s search for Bob Ferris continues, she faces an onslaught of challenges - false report numbers, deceptive elder protective services, and the frustration of navigating an untrustworthy system. Yet, hope shines through as we discuss the strides Liz is making to find answers - obtaining police reports and looking into body camera footage. Despite the obstacles, Liz stands tall, drawing strength from her partner and the promise of truth that lies ahead. Buckle up as we explore this rollercoaster journey, a testament to Liz Ferris\u0027 resilience and a story you won\u0027t want to miss.\n\nBFG Store now Live!  https://blownforgood-shop.fourthwall.com\nBlown For Good Website: http://blownforgood.com/\n\nPODCAST INFO:\nPodcast website: https://www.buzzsprout.com/2131160/share\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/blown-for-good-behind-the-iron-curtain-of-scientology/id1671284503\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6NZGCcRjr8jQRFrqugdfJK\nRSS: https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/2131160.rss\n\nYOUTUBE PLAYLISTS:\nSpy Files: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq4cA-eBNXD1q9jD729pQmWk\n\nScientology Stories: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq5G35lu2nxviwc_XueI_Xmk\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nSupport the Channel: \n\nPaypal Link - No Paypal account needed\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=7ZXJBQVYP4WXS\n\n\nThinking of buying a Tesla?

Take a trip with us to her early days in Texas, where her parents\u0027 involvement with the Church of Scientology began. We explore how Scientology quickly consumed her family, leading to Shelly\u0027s parents leaving her and her siblings while they travelled to England. This departure marked the beginning of the fractures within her family, a significant event that would later shape Shelly\u0027s life. We also unearth the disturbing chapters from her childhood, which saw her living in questionable conditions in Mexico, forced to hide at the sight of authorities.\n\nDelving deeper into Shelly\u0027s life, we discuss her time as a part of the Commodore\u0027s Messenger Organization, Golden Era Productions, and Author Services in Los Angeles. We illuminate the changes that came with David Miscavige taking over the Religious Technology Center, leading to her recall to the headquarters in 1987. Finally, we bring to light her relationship with L Ron Hubbard and the interesting story behind her nickname, \u0027Miss Panache\u0027. This episode offers a thorough exploration of the life and disappearance of Shelly Miscavige, pulling back the veil on the often-secretive world of Scientology. Tune in as we unravel this mysterious tale.\n\nEDITOR NOTE: We are aware there is a bit of static in this video but it is only when Marc is talking so we left it.

      "description": "The Aftermath Foundation was established to help those who want to leave Scientology and the Sea Organization, but who lack a system of support they can rely on while getting on their feet in the outside world.\n\nThis is an Aftermath Foundation Survivor Story: The Story of Serge Obolensky.\n\nSerge was raised in scientology from a very young age and joined the Sea Organization at age 11, committing to a billion years of service to scientology. Serge\u0027s parents and his brothers were also part of the Sea Organization. After several years of hard labor, no education, no family support, and a rigorous schedule, Serge\u0027s life was in ruins. At age 19, while he was living on L Ron Hubbard Way, Serge had a fireworks accident in which he lost both of his hands and one of his eyes. Thereafter he was promptly cut off from his family and all mental and emotional support, as a result of which Serge was homeless on Hollywood Blvd for 10 years.\n\nThe Aftermath Foundation presents The Story of Serge Obolensky.\n\nBFG Store is now Live!  https://blownforgood-shop.fourthwall.com\n\nSubscribe to SPTV:  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/@michaelrinder5831\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@GrowingUpInScientology\n\nBlown For Good Website: http://blownforgood.com/\n\nPODCAST INFO:\nPodcast website: https://www.buzzsprout.com/2131160/share\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/blown-for-good-behind-the-iron-curtain-of-scientology/id1671284503\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6NZGCcRjr8jQRFrqugdfJK\nRSS: https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/2131160.rss\n\nYOUTUBE PLAYLISTS:\nSpy Files: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq4cA-eBNXD1q9jD729pQmWk\n\nScientology Stories: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq5G35lu2nxviwc_XueI_Xmk\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nSupport the Channel: \n\nPaypal Link - No Paypal account needed\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=7ZXJBQVYP4WXS\n\n\nThinking of buying a Tesla?

Join us as we interview Hana Eltringham Whitfield, who appeared in the HBO Documentary Going Clear, Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath, to name two of many documentaries.\n\nHana was a Scientologist and a member of the Sea Organization for over twenty years. She captained two of Hubbard\u2019s ships, ran his organizations, and was Deputy Commodore under Hubbard in the United States for two years. After Hana left, and as a way of giving back, Hana and her late husband, Jerry Whitfield began helping families retrieve their children and spouses from Scientology and the Sea Org.

      "description": "BFG Store now Live! \nhttps://blownforgood-shop.fourthwall.com\n\nIn this series we will explore the life and experiences of Shelly Miscavige, leading up to Shelly\u0027s current status as one of many missing executives in Scientology. Shelly was the second in command to David Miscavige for many years, not to mention she is his wife. Now she hasn\u0027t been seen or heard from in many years. How can someone outright disappear in today\u0027s world? How does Scientology get away with this? How can Scientology\u0027s programming run so deep that people in Scientology accept this as normal? Our first guest is Marc Headley, who we interview to get Marc\u0027s perspective and experience having known and worked with Shelly Miscavige for 15 years at the 500 acre compound located in Gilman Hot Springs, CA.\n\nSubscribe to SPTV:  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/@michaelrinder5831\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@GrowingUpInScientology\n\n#scientology #davidmiscavige #dannymasterson #shellymiscavige #davemiscavige #scientologyandtheaftermath #sptv \n\nBlown For Good Website: http://blownforgood.com/\n\nBFG Store:\nhttp://blownforgood-shop.fourthwall.com/\n\nPODCAST INFO:\nPodcast website: https://www.buzzsprout.com/2131160/share\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/blown-for-good-behind-the-iron-curtain-of-scientology/id1671284503\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6NZGCcRjr8jQRFrqugdfJK\nRSS: https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/2131160.rss\n\nYOUTUBE PLAYLISTS:\nSpy Files: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq4cA-eBNXD1q9jD729pQmWk\n\nScientology Stories: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtJfniWLwq5G35lu2nxviwc_XueI_Xmk\n\nSupport the Channel: \n\nPaypal Link - No Paypal account needed\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=7ZXJBQVYP4WXS\n\nThinking of buying a Tesla?
