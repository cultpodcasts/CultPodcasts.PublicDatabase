The ex-wife of megachurch pastor and author of \u0022I Kissed Dating Goodbye\u0022 Joshua Harris, Shannon was not born into evangelicalism, but was pulled in as a young adult. Shannon tells of giving up more and more of her identity in service to her husband\u0027s ministry, and how deconstruction led the two of them down different paths. We highly recommend this book. We agree that it is an excellent deconstruction memoir.

This claim was widely believed to be fact within fundamentalist and evangelical circles. Some church services even played an alleged recording that was made of the screams that according to legend, was made when the scientists lowered a specialized heat-resistant microphone into the 1100C pit. On this episode, we examine the details of this claim in an attempt to prove or disprove its validity.Source post for this episode is available as a free post on our patreon, at Patreon.com/LeavingEdenPodcastAn extended, uncensored, and ad-free version of this podcast episode is available to subscribers at Patreon.com/LeavingEdenPodcastTW: In general we talk about a lot of potentially triggering topics on this show, including but not limited to suicide and mental health, racism, misogyny, PTSD and PTSD symptoms, child abuse, mental, physical, and sexual abuse, and spiritual abuse including guilt, shame, and fear.

      "description": "In what is quite possibly Leaving Eden Podcast\u0027s most requested episode ever, Sadie and Gavi discuss Jonestown, The People\u2019s Temple, and the massacre that occurred there in November of 1978.TW: In general we talk about a lot of potentially triggering topics on this show, including but not limited to suicide and mental health, racism, misogyny, PTSD and PTSD symptoms, child abuse, mental, physical, and sexual abuse, and spiritual abuse including guilt, shame, and fear. In most episodes we\u2019ll mention at least a few of these topics, but we try very hard to avoid graphic detail unless it\u2019s relevant to the story we\u2019re telling, and we do our best to give the audience a heads-up before going into detail on any of these topics. In this episode, of course we are going to be discussing many deaths by suicide, the majority of which were coerced or forced, and the death of many children, but we think that\u2019s obvious from the episode title and the topic we\u2019re discussing. We are also going to be talking about a lot of very twisted humiliation rituals, control and brainwashing and blackmail rituals, this goes a bit deeper than we were initially aware of. Of course we will give you a heads up before we drop any graphic details, but as usual we are going to err on the side of not glorifying abuse and letting listeners seek out the darker details if they want to. Additionally, you may be confused by or disagree with our portrayals of The People\u2019s Temple, Jim Jones, and his followers. While obviously Jim Jones was a murderer and a controlling and abusive person, it is important to explore his positive attributes in order to explain what his followers saw in him and why they trusted him to begin with. To not do so would be to portray them as witless sheep led to slaughter which would be against the mission of this podcast and also disrespectful to the memories of those who died in 1978 as a result of the actions of Jim Jones.An extended, uncensored, and ad-free version of this podcast episode is available to subscribers at Patreon.com/LeavingEdenPodcastWE HAVE NEW MERCH AVAILABLE, AND A NEW MERCH SHOP, at https://leavingedenpodcast.threadless.comStream the Leaving Eden Podcast theme song, Rolling River of Time on Spotify!https://open.spotify.com/artist/6lB7RwSQ9X5gnt1BDNugyS?si=jVhmqFfYRSiruRxekdLgKA.Join our Facebook Discussion group!https://www.facebook.com/groups/edenexodusJoin our subreddit!Reddit.com/r/EdenExodusInstagram:https://www.instagram.com/leavingedenpodcast/https://www.instagram.com/sadiecarpentermusic/https://www.instagram.com/gavrielhacohen/Twitter:https://twitter.com/LeavingEdenPodhttps://twitter.com/HellYeahSadiehttps://twitter.com/GavrielHacohenFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/LeavingEdenPodcasthttps://www.facebook.com/GavrielHaCohen--- Send in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/leavingedenpodcast/messageSupport this podcast: https://anchor.fm/leavingedenpodcast/support Get bonus content on Patreon Hosted on Acast.

      "description": "Jack Schaap has been out of prison all summer. Within days of his release, he is required by law to register as a sex offender. He has not done this. Sadie and Gavi are looking into just how he manages to get away with this.\u00A0Content Warning: In general we talk about a lot of potentially triggering topics on this show, including but not limited to suicide and mental health, racism, misogyny, PTSD and PTSD symptoms, child abuse, mental, physical, and sexual abuse, and spiritual abuse including guilt, shame, and fear. In most episodes we\u2019ll mention at least a few of these topics, but we try very hard to avoid graphic detail unless it\u2019s relevant to the story we\u2019re telling, and we do our best to give the audience a heads-up before going into detail on any of these topics. This episode is about Jack Schaap, a former pastor who served jail time for sex trafficking of a minor. We don\u2019t have any reason to go into great detail about his crime on this episode, but the general topic of sexual assault of a minor and sex trafficking will be throughout the episode. He also, spoiler alert, is not yet registered with the national sex offender registry, and this is something that gives some people anxiety, especially those of us who knew him, so if that\u2019s a trigger for you, be aware that it is the topic of this episode.WE HAVE NEW MERCH AVAILABLE, AND A NEW MERCH SHOP, at https://leavingedenpodcast.threadless.comStream the Leaving Eden Podcast theme song, Rolling River of Time on Spotify! https://open.spotify.com/artist/6lB7RwSQ9X5gnt1BDNugyS?si=jVhmqFfYRSiruRxekdLgKA.Join our Facebook Discussion group! https://www.facebook.com/groups/edenexodusJoin our subreddit!

This episode is about Bob Jones University and how the history of this fundamentalist school intersects with the history of American fundamentalism itself. The big trigger warnings for this episode are racism and sexual abuse, and really, really gross victim blaming. There is just so much of all of those in this episode. The racism is just everywhere, but I\u2019ll give you a heads up before we get to the specifics of the victim blaming tactics.Sources for this episode are available on a free Patreon post at Patreon.com/LeavingEdenPodcastThis episode is sponsored by Better Help!
