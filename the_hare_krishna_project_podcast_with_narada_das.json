At the age of just 26 he was managing a council\u2019s education budget of \u00A372million, with over 50 staff under his direction.\n\nBy the age of 30 though he realised he wasn\u2019t happy and wanted something \u2018deeper\u2019 in life, so gave it all up to join ISKCON\u2019s Festival Programme in the UK (little did he know what this would eventually lead to!).\n\nAfter 10 years serving with the programme Narada finally left and became the whistleblower that led to the Police and Charity Commission\u2019s investigation into ISKCON UK\u2019s misuse of public funds in 2021.\n\nNow, Narada runs The Hare Krishna Project and is a campaigner for a more inclusive, open and \u2018accepting\u2019 Hare Krishna movement where all people feel included.\n\nHe works as a journalist and communications consultant. He\u2019s also an author with his second book \u2018Black Magic, Booze and Bhakti\u2019 is due to be published in 2024! \n\nThis week\u2019s podcast is not to be missed!\n\nYou can watch it:\n\n- On Facebook at www.facebook.com/TheHareKrishnaProject \n- and on YouTube at www.youtube.com/@NaradaDasUK\n\nFor more details about The Hare Krishna Project check out our website www.theharekrishnaproject.org.uk\n\n#Podcast #TheHareKrishnaProject #HareKrishna #Podcast #Whistleblower #Author #Journalist",
