      "description": "Disclaimer: Not all of the views, beliefs, and core values expressed by guests on this podcast necessarily reflect the view, beliefs, and core values of Liza Lovett or the Warriors Community. I found today\u0027s guest on Medium.com. I have read many of his articles and really loved them. In the last decade, I have had too many conversations with people who were damaged or confused by the purity culture movement in the church. Too many people have come forward with sexual abuse stories despite such conservative or extreme purity teachings in the church. Vytautas writes about purity in the church in such an intentional, careful, and Biblical way. So! I invited him to speak on the podcast.

This conversation is a topic I\u0027ve wrestled with recently and a topic I am sure everyone can relate to struggling with now and then. I am talking about what happens when people attack you. How do you respond? What do you give space to or open yourself up to when you are being attacked? What happens in your head and your heart? Due to recent events, I had to take a step back, check my heart, check my stance, and spend a lot of time on my knees in prayer. I wrestled through a lot of hurt and anger and I want to take time to share that with you and how I came to the healthy place I am in now.
