I\u0027ve mentioned a podcast I discovered a few months ago on the podcast before. And now I have one of the podcast hosts joining me today! Amanda Turnbull is co-host of the Burning Butterflies Podcast where she and her co-host talk about their journey through a cult. They start at the very beginning and take you through it all! When I first listened to the Burning Butterflies podcast, I was amazed at how deeply I could relate to each episode. Today, Amanda shares part of her story about her experience in a cult and how she disentangled her beliefs once she left.
