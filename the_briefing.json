      "description": "Cult leader Jim Jones ordered his followers in the jungle of South America\u2019s Guyana to drink punch-laced cyanide under the promise that they would be granted access to paradise. The compound in which Jones lived, preached and ultimately murdered hundreds of people has been reclaimed by the jungle and closed off since the late 70s. But a local travel agency has just started tours to the site, promising to honour the victims and their memories.\n But is it insensitive for tourists to visit a location with such a dark and tragic past? Or is it no different to the tourism we see at Auschwitz, the 9/11 site or Chernobyl? In this episode of The Briefing, Chris Spyrou speaks with tour organiser from Wanderlust Adventures, Roselyn Sewcharran.\u00A0\n Follow The Briefing:\u00A0TikTok: @listnrnewsroom Instagram: @listnrnewsroom\u00A0@thebriefingpodcast YouTube:\u00A0@LiSTNRnewsroom Facebook: @LiSTNR Newsroom\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",
