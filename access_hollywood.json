      "description": "Bethany Joy Lenz is sharing her truth. During a wide-ranging sit-down interview with Access Hollywood\u0027s Zuri Hall, the \u0022One Tree Hill\u0022 alum got candid about her experience of being in a cult and explained why she didn\u0027t speak out until now, sharing, \u0022I think anytime we go through trauma there\u0027s always shame attached to it and you\u0027re not sure about how people are going to perceive you and you don\u0027t want to be categorized and lumped in as like oh the girl who was in a cult \u2026 so that\u0027s now what I am every time I walk into a room, I don\u0027t want that, I\u0027m so much more than that, but I think that happens to so many of us because of so many different things in our lives. People just like to put labels and categories on everyone and so that was a big part of it just feeling like I don\u0027t know how to talk about this where I feel like I\u0027ll be really understood and I was kind of terrified of being misunderstood.\u0022 Bethany also talked about her new single \u0022Strawberries\u0022 and revealed the inspiration behind the track, which is available to stream Aug. 18.",
