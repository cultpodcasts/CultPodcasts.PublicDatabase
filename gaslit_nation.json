      "description": "How does Franco\u2019s reign in Spain connect to the rise of Trump? In this gripping true-crime thriller, financial journalist Gareth Gore, while investigating a bank collapse in Spain, follows the money trail to uncover a vast international conspiracy behind Opus Dei. What is Opus Dei? It\u0027s a shadowy global right-wing organization founded in Spain just before the Spanish Civil War. Supported by powerful Republican figures like Leonard Leo, Opus Dei is a Christian nationalist movement fueling efforts to dismantle democracy and pave the way for dictatorship in America. Gore, the author of the explosive book Opus: The Cult of Dark Money, Human Trafficking, and Right-Wing Conspiracy Inside the Catholic Church , delves into this insidious network. In this chilling conversation, recorded just before the U.S. election, Gore reveals how Opus Dei\u2019s influence stretches from Capitol Hill to the Supreme Court\u2014and what is being done, including by the Pope, to try to curb its destructive power. This week\u0027s bonus show features a live interview with Dr. Emma Briant, one of the world\u2019s foremost experts on disinformation warfare and propaganda. Dr. Briant, co-editor of The Routledge Handbook on the Influence Industry and author of Propaganda and Counter-Terrorism: Strategies for Global Change, shares invaluable insights into the weapons of global propaganda.
