      "description": "Can ancient scripture be reinterpreted to erase racism? Mormon apologists are attempting just that with controversial \u0027skin of blackness\u0027 passages in the Book of Mormon. But can these efforts stand up to historical scrutiny, or do they merely obscure uncomfortable truths? Critics argue it whitewashes history and denies lived experiences. Join us as we critically examine how modern LDS apologists attempt to explain away racist teachings in early Mormon history and scripture by comparing their modern interpretations with the information they avoid most strenuously--the original words and primary sources of the doctrines to begin with.",

      "description": "In the 1950s and 60s, the Mormon church faced internal turmoil as a group of intellectuals known as the \u0022Swearing Elders\u0022 challenged orthodox doctrines. This clash between free-thinking scholars and conservative leaders like Joseph Fielding Smith led to attempts at excommunication, spy infiltration, and the firing of liberal educators. Amidst this tension, Church President David O. McKay emerged as an unexpected protector of intellectual freedom. The period also saw the church grappling with civil rights issues and racial policies, as public pressure forced leaders to confront their teachings. This tumultuous era set the stage for decades of struggle between faith, scholarship, and authority in Mormonism.",

      "description": "As the first to be \u201Cborn in the covenant\u201D to convert parents, Rian Anderson\u0027s world revolved around the Church, until her mission became a crucible of mental anguish and familial tension. Expecting her experience to be one based on love and service, Rian was instead met with strict rules, surveillance, and spiritual turmoil as she continually felt forced to act against her own conscience \u0026 integrity. As the oppressive atmosphere coupled with isolation due to the initial rise of COVID began to take its toll on her mental and physical health, Rian cherished her weekly calls with her family. That is, until her family\u2019s mounting concern for Rian\u2019s welfare coincided with their loss of faith in the church. As Rian battled depression and suicidal thoughts, her mission leaders\u0027 response was shocking: accusations of pride and instructions to cut ties with her doubting family. Certain that their concern for Rian\u2019s spiritual well-being was superior to the love her \u201Cfallen\u201D family had to offer back home, her Mission President and his wife insert themselves as surrogate parents for the remainder of her mission and beyond. Despite this initial interference, Rian finds herself facing her own faith crisis. As she considers what the actions of her \u201Cmission parents\u201D truly cost her, Rian discovers for herself the real meaning of family, and her family had it all along.",

      "description": "In this compelling rebroadcast (first time on youtube), we revisit John Dehlin\u0027s 2012 interview with Tom Phillips, a U.K. convert and former LDS stake president whose close friendships with LDS leaders like Harold Hillam, Gordon Hinkley, Russel Ballard, and Jeffrey Holland likely led to the invitation to receive the religion\u0027s most exclusive ordinance, the Second Anointing. However, Tom\u0027s journey would soon take an unexpected turn after taking part in the secretive ritual which would have repercussions for his place among the community and even his own family. Since the original episode, an intriguing twist has emerged: Tom\u0027s son, Alan, has ascended to the role of General Authority in the Church, despite his father\u0027s well-documented disaffection. This development adds a poignant layer to an already complex narrative of faith, doubt, and family dynamics within the LDS Church. Whether you\u0027re hearing this story for the first time or revisiting it with fresh ears, Tom Phillips\u0027 journey continues to resonate, raising thought-provoking questions about faith, truth, and the accountability and privilege of Mormonism\u0027s top leaders.",

Smith and Joseph Fielding Smith, both Mormon leaders, could not find any doctrinal bases for the priesthood and temple ban and yet it still remained for decades. Members of the church performed blackface and wrote racist poems published in church periodicals. Many of the Mormon leaders did not agree with the ban and some were even removed from their callings because of their different opinions.

Is the right to preserve one\u0027s membership intact a privilege reserved only for select LGBT Mormons? How is the Church guiding these decisions? Are divine revelations to local leaders influenced by the affluence of their congregations? Is God giving different revelations depending on the level of backlash anticipated from local members?

      "description": "In a gripping and vulnerable interview, Lori takes us on her journey of being raised in a picture-perfect Mormon household, only to find herself betrayed by the misogynistic teachings and practices of the Church. As a feminist trapped in a patriarchal system, she recounts the jarring experience of going through the temple for the first time, feeling like she had entered a cult. Despite her discomfort, she persevered for decades, until the cognitive dissonance and oppression of women triggered debilitating panic attacks and a mental health crisis. Lori\u0027s courageous story is a testament to the strength it takes to break free from indoctrination, find one\u0027s authentic self, and embrace true peace and equality outside the confines of orthodoxy. Her raw honesty about the harmful effects of Mormonism on women\u0027s mental health and her path to healing and purpose will resonate deeply with anyone who has struggled to reconcile their beliefs with their lived experience.

Sebastian takes us on a wild ride as he dishes about the viral rise of his \u0022Black Menaces\u0022 group, a provocative movement that fearlessly called out racism within Mormon culture. From protests that sparked national headlines to tense confrontations with horrified church leaders like Brad Wilcox, Sebastian holds nothing back. He delves into the trauma of being constantly stared at and \u0022othered\u0022 on BYU\u0027s overwhelmingly white campus, receiving vile racist abuse and death threats just for daring to speak truth to power. Sebastian\u0027s story is a raw, unsettling wake-up call about the insidious persistence of racism, even in religious communities that preach love and equality. Get ready to have your perceptions shattered by this bold revolutionary\u0027s refusal to stay silent in the face of oppression.

      "description": "What happens when a multiracial woman raised in a loving family that valued advocacy, positivity, and education joins the Mormon church? Summur\u0027s fascinating journey takes you from her NFL player father desegregating a team, to her mother fiercely protecting her from bullies and racism. Despite nurturing experiences at home, Summur faced harsh judgments and segregationist attitudes at church - a stark contrast that began shaping her doubts. Her path winds through BYU, an African American Studies class that unveiled new perspectives, and a traumatic racist cop incident, before working as a flight attendant and meeting her husband. With a unique multicultural lens, Summur shares the powerful family influences, eye-opening experiences, and pivotal moments like a young girl\u0027s innocent \u0022Look mommy, a Lamanite\u0022 comment that led her to fundamentally question certain Mormon teachings and toxic cultures like purity culture.

Anette Dennis\u0027s sermon broadcast to women of the church, which was uploaded to the LDS Church\u0027s official Instagram account. Panelists include: Julia Sanders, Celeste Davis, Samantha Shelley, and Alyssa Witbeck. This riveting interview takes a deep dive into the church\u0027s recent Women\u0027s Devotional - an event intended to empower female members but one that generated significant controversy. Hear candid analysis unpacking the mixed messaging around their supposed \u0022power and authority\u0022, and the perceived dissonance between leader\u0027s rhetoric and the reality of women\u0027s restricted roles. No topic is off-limits in this thought-provoking look at how the devotional aimed to honor women\u0027s divine roles while still upholding traditional male leadership.

      "description": "Ever wonder what happens when a faithful Mormon Bible scholar has a crisis of faith and steps away from the religion he dedicated his life to? David Bokovoy\u0027s candid interview takes you on a riveting personal journey from staunch believer to \u0022spiritual atheist.\u0022 He pulls no punches in describing how the Church\u0027s controversial 2015 LGBTQ\u0026#43; policy shattered his worldview, leading him to lose his testimony and leave Mormonism behind. With raw honesty and hard-won wisdom, he shares profound insights about the transformative power of education from his work in prison rehabilitation. He grapples with weighty questions of free will, authenticity, and human connection. You\u0027ll be captivated by his stories of finding the \u0022Holy Ghost\u0022 outside of religion, confronting trauma through therapy, and continually evolving his understanding of truth. Brimming with thought-provoking perspectives on everything from ADHD to patriarchy to psychedelics, Bokovoy\u0027s interview is a must-see for anyone on their own journey of self-discovery beyond rigid belief systems.

David has an MA from Brandeis University in Jewish Studies and a Ph.D. in Hebrew Bible and the Ancient Near East. He worked for the LDS Church Education System for 18 years, was chaplain at Harvard University, and taught LDS Institute at Harvard, Wellesley, and MIT. He is the author of 2 books including Authoring the Old Testament: Genesis-Deuteronomy, dozens of articles, and was a co-founder of the Mormon Interpreter with Daniel C. Peterson. This interview focuses on David\u0027s personal faith journey, including his fascinating story of falling in love with the Hebrew language and deeply studying the Bible\u2014to forgoing a possibly more lucrative academic career to move to Utah to teach in the Church Educational System.

Key topics discussed are the problems of evil and human agency, Mormon concepts of the afterlife, the elaborate powers ascribed to Satan, theological issues like why an all-powerful God would allow Satan to thrive or even reward him in the end. Larsen argues these issues point to flaws in the Mormon Plan of Salvation and suggests Satan must be part of the Godhead, concluding that Mormon doctrines concerning Satan lead to profound philosophical problems in Mormon theology.

Michael Quinn, from being arch-enemies due to their clashing views on Mormon history, to gaining an appreciation for Quinn\u0027s tireless research into difficult aspects of LDS history, even as she remains puzzled by his persistent belief in Mormonism despite uncovering many factual problems. Sandra highlights Quinn\u0027s lifelong quest to reconcile his faith with the uncomfortable realities he uncovered, his struggles with Church leadership over his historical writings, the irony of him publishing an anti-Tanner pamphlet, and the sadness of his eventual excommunication which rejected both him as a person due to his sexuality and his meticulously researched historical analysis which the Church disliked. Ultimately, Sandra expresses a wish that Quinn was still alive to have an open discussion given their intertwined, conflicted past. Chosen Path: A Memoir: Quinn, D.

Brian shares intimate details about his experiences with Mormon rules around sexuality and how he tested whether sinning really caused loss of the Spirit. Ultimately, Brian found peace and healing after leaving the LDS church, regaining relationships with his kids, and finding a healthier marriage outside Mormonism.

With empathy and nuance, they peel back the curtain on issues like LGBTQ exclusion, leader worship, doubted spiritual \u0027gifts\u0027, unhealthy perfectionism, and the people left wounded when conference talks supersede mental health expertise - all while recognizing the very real human desire to do good amidst institutions not structured to support it.

Despite feeling unprepared, she experienced the birth of her first child within the confines of Mormon teachings, grappling with the disconnection she felt towards motherhood and the expectations placed upon women. Tara delves into the erasure of women\u0027s roles within Mormon theology, feeling disrespected and marginalized. She confronts the sexist doctrines and rituals of the faith, ultimately realizing the toxicity of the environment and its limitations on her identity and well-being. Through personal and familial trials, including PTSD and infertility, Tara navigates her disillusionment with Mormonism, finding solace in stepping away from its constraints and embracing a more liberated perspective on life and motherhood. Despite fluctuating emotions towards her past experiences, Tara prioritizes her mental health and autonomy, recognizing the importance of complexity and personal growth over the pursuit of a simplistic notion of happiness propagated by her former faith.

Raised with four biological siblings, she navigates her identity as a black girl in Utah, where she initially struggles to recognize her racial difference. Despite feeling out of place, she engages with Mormonism deeply, experiencing conflicting emotions about her faith and cultural identity. Tara\u0027s journey evolves through high school, where she grapples with societal perceptions of blackness, sexuality, and Mormon teachings on race and gender roles. Her mission to Atlanta, Georgia, exposes her to systemic racism within the Mormon Church and the broader community, challenging her beliefs and sense of self. Despite enduring trauma and grappling with guilt and shame, Tara finds solace in her eventual marriage and motherhood, yet continues to confront the complexities of her Mormon upbringing and racial identity.

She discusses the immense pressure she felt to be perfect and avoid any behavior considered sinful. This culminated when, at age 17, her parents discovered she had been intimate with her boyfriend and secretly sent her away to a strict religious behavioral modification camp called \u0022Lifeline\u0022 in Salt Lake City without her knowledge or consent. Becky recounts the traumatic experiences at this camp, including the rigid rules, lack of credentials among staff, and the emotional manipulation tactics. She explains how the ordeal negatively affected her self-worth and strained relationships in her life for years after. Becky emphasizes the lack of understanding about normal adolescent behavior in these religious communities, the damage caused by guilt and shame, and the need for more open, understanding parenting. She hopes that increased awareness and support for youth might prevent this from happening to others. Episode Show Notes YouTube Link \u00A0  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

      "description": "In this interview, Chelsea Goodrich details years of sexual abuse by her father, former Mormon bishop John Goodrich, beginning when she was a young child. When confronted in 2015, John admitted the abuse to both Chelsea\u0027s mother and their Mormon leaders. However, the church failed to act to protect Chelsea, support victims, or warn others. John faced excommunication but no criminal charges due to statute of limitations. In 2017, another victim came forward alleging John drugged and raped her. Despite evidence, prosecutors eventually only tried John for illegal drugging. Meanwhile, John remarried and had access to grandchildren, prompting safety concerns for Chelsea. Desperate, Chelsea and her mother sought help from church representative Paul Rytting only to be offered settlement money and asked to sign nondisclosure agreements. Ultimately, Chelsea decides to go public to protect other potential victims from a predator still left free. Her story exposes the patterns of coverups, victim blaming, inaction, and secrecy in the Mormon church around abuse.

They discuss how some Mormon teachings can distort views on \u0022morality\u0022 and discipline. The hosts argue the Mormon church needs to take some responsibility by re-examining certain teachings that may enable abuse by followers.

      "description": "Mormon Stories Podcast is truly at a crossroads. We have had our highest impact year of all time (by far) in 2023, but we have also lost several recurring donors that have not been replaced by new donors. We have also been the subject of fierce attacks that have been extremely expensive financially, and in terms of time and emotional energy. We are currently at the point of possibly needing to reduce our efforts, unless at least a few hundred monthly donors step up to replace the donors we lost over the past two years. If you find value in Mormon Stories podcast - either for yourself or for the broader community - please consider becoming a monthly donor today. Thank you.

From bloodline beliefs linking them to Jesus to intricate rules dictating marriages, the Order\u0027s control over its members is striking. In this gripping interview with Amanda Rae, we dive deep into the secretive world of The Order, exploring its history, shocking practices, and the personal experiences of those raised within it. Amanda unveils the manipulation and trauma faced by women, the indoctrination of children in their schools, and the stark realities of life under polygamous marriages. Revealing her own journey, Amanda shares her struggle for freedom and the challenges faced after leaving. Her recounting of institutionalized financial fraud, emotional manipulation, and attempts to break free from The Order\u0027s grip are both heart-wrenching and eye-opening. Tune in for an insider\u0027s perspective, confronting the darker aspects of cults, survival after leaving, and the ongoing healing process.

Lindsay Hansen Park and Bryan Buchanan guide us through the schisms, scandals and sexual dynamics of this era, from the chaotic leadership struggles in Nauvoo to the restrictive culture of polygamy in Utah. We examine how polygamy hindered missionary work and statehood, the harsh realities for women, the escalating conflicts with the US government, and the 1870s crackdown on plural marriage. Despite sympathizing with early Mormons, the hosts candidly critique problematic teachings and figures like Brigham Young. They argue that Mormonism still struggles from a reluctance to denounce past errors, which allows those harmful ideas to persist and hurt people today. This no-holds-barred journey illuminates a complex chapter of Mormon history.",

Themes of spiritual scrupulosity and the ominous echoes of evil spirits were deeply ingrained. Her father\u0027s prepper mindset, financial exploitation, and extreme beliefs added to the tumult. Josh\u0027s narrative exposes the suffocating expectations of righteousness and conditional love, culminating in his distressing mission experience and subsequent social rejection.\n This candid conversation delves into the challenges and repercussions of rigid Mormon ideology, underscoring the profound impacts on individuals and families. The gripping insights shared here provide a raw and thought-provoking glimpse into the complex realities faced by many within the Mormon community.\n \n Sweet Red Poppy - Cricut, Sewing, Crafting \u0026 DIY Tutorials\n \n Episode Show Notes\n YouTube Link\n \u00A0\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

      "description": "Today we will discuss someone described as the \u0022spiritual leader\u0022 of alleged murders Chad Daybell and Lori Vallow, alleged abuser Tim Ballard, and recently-imprisoned Jodi Hildebrandt.\n Thom Harrison is a prominent Utah therapist who published a book called \u0022Visions of Glory\u0022 in 2012, focusing on three of his alleged near death experiences (including personal visitations from Jesus Christ). As has been uncovered over the past few years, Thom Harrison\u0027 and his book \u0022Visions of Glory\u0022 have been highly influential across the Mormon \u0022prepper\u0022 neo-fundamentalist community, and particularly in the lives and stories of Chad Daybell, Lori Vallow, Tim Ballard, Jodi Hildebrant, as well as other \u0022preppers\u0022 such as Julie Rowe, Rod Meldrum, and alleged abuser-therapist Maurice Harker.\n Part of what has made Visions of Glory so successful is that Thom (through the pseudonym Spencer) claims in his book that his visions were approved of by an un-named Mormon apostle (who now is known to be the late Neal A. Maxwell).\n Finally, we will discuss how the Mormon church was made aware of Thom Harrison and his book in the 2012-2013 time period, and chose to promote Thom to bishop instead of to punish him and/or stop the publishing of his book.\n Lauren Matthias (Hidden True Crime Podcast), Megan Connor (Lori Vallow\u0027s cousin), and Mindy Caldwell (Mormon super-sluether) will be joining us for this panel discussion.\n Episode Show Notes\n YouTube Link\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

      "title": "8 Passenger\u0027s Therapist: Court Order to Remove Adam Steed Interview \u0026 Call for Stories",
      "description": "I have some sad and some possibly happy news to announce. First the sad news. Mormon Stories Podcast has just received today a temporary restraining order requiring us to take down our interview of Adam Paul Steed - the courageous whistleblower to Mormon church Boy Scout sexual abuse in Idaho, and one of the many victims of 8 Passengers Therapist Jodi Hildebrandt. We are not at liberty to discuss publicly the details of the restraining order at this time. For those who were not yet able to see Adam Steed\u0027s interview, in it he focused on the following: 1) His story of courageously speaking up as a victim of Mormon-church backed child abuse in its Idaho Boy Scout program, 2) How he and his father fought to successful change the statue of limitation laws for child sexual abuse victims in Idaho, 3) How he and his young family (while at BYU) were referred to therapist Jodi Hildebrandt by his Mormon bishop, 4) How (by Adam\u0027s report) Jodi Hildebrandt destroyed both his reputation and his family, through various unethical therapy practices, including violating his confidentiality by reporting false and/or confidential information to the BYU Honor Code Office, leading to his suspension from BYU. 5) How he fought back against Jodi Hildebrandt by successfully getting Jodi Hildebrandt\u0027s license suspended. And finally, 6) Adam\u0027s firm belief that the Mormon church intentionally weaponized Jodi Hildebrandt and her tactics to destroy both his life and his family, in part as retaliation for his work as a Boy Scout abuse whistleblower within the Mormon church. Because of the importance of Adam\u0027s story, we are heartbroken to have to take it down (for now). Especially after hearing from thousands of Mormons, post-Mormons, and never-Mormons who found Adam\u0027s story to be validating and/or healing. Here\u0027s the good news: this week we are actively working with a few major media outlets to: 1) Give voice to the victims of Jodi Hildebrandt, of other Mormon church-recommended \u0022sex addiction\u0022 therapists like \u0022Sons of Helaman,\u0022 \u0022Fight the New Drug,\u0022 and Lifestar, as well as and from the Mormon church\u0027s \u0022Addiction and Recovery Program\u0022 targeting its members for \u0022sex addiction.\u0022 And: 2) Hold both the Mormon church and these unethical therapists including Jodi Hildebrandt accountable for their unethical malpractice. Here\u0027s what we need from you: If you or someone you love has been harmed by either:  Jodi Hildebrandt, a Mormon church-recommended \u0022sex addiction\u0022 therapist (like Sons of Helaman or Lifestar), or \u00A0from the Mormon church\u0027s \u0022Addiction and Recovery Program\u0022 (wherein healthy, normative behaviors were pathologized as \u0022sex addiction\u0022), please email your story as soon as possible to mormonstories@gmail.com.  In your email, please include the following sections:  The date range that you worked with these people. We are particularly interested in patients recommended to Jodi Hildebrandt and others like her AFTER 2012. The names of the therapist(s) or you worked with. Any detail you can provide about who recommended you (especially if a Mormon church bishop or leader). A description of the unethical therapy practices and how they harmed you. And A confirmation of whether or not you are willing to speak with a journalist, either on the record or off the record.  Again, please email this information to mormonstories@gmail.com as soon as you are able. Finally, we promise you that at Mormon Stories Podcast, we will do everything we can to:  Restore Adam Paul Steed\u0027s Mormon story, Help you and other victims tell your stories about Jodi Hildebrandt and/or other unethical Mormon therapists, and practices, and \u00A0Help both the Mormon church and its unethical therapists and programs be held accountable for the harm that they have caused so many individuals and families.

      "description": "Lupe (Mayorga) Bartholomew is American Idol finalist David Archuleta\u0027s mother. Lupe, her mother, and her three sisters joined the LDS church in Honduras on September 22, 1978. Ultimately, Lupe and her family came to the United States to live the Mormon dream. Lupe lived as a very happy, fully believing, orthodox Mormon mother until 2022, when her son, David, came out as gay. David\u0027s difficulties with the LDS Church\u0027s LGTBQ policies and doctrines caused Lupe to begin questioning the Mormon faith that she loved. This is Lupe\u0027s Mormon story.\n Episode Show Notes\n Youtube Link\n \u00A0\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

      "description": "Join LatterGayStories for a black-tie art gayla! In 2014, the Mormon church stopped printing The Miracle of Forgiveness. By 2015 they began removing copies from their bookstore shelves at Deseret Book. Even though the printed version was culled, Deseret Book continued to sell digital-download copies of the book online. In 2021, LatterGayStories started the #TrashTheStash movement, encouraging its audience to remove copies of The Miracle of Forgiveness from bookshelves, home libraries, church buildings, and thrift stores. In the first year, our audience removed nearly 6,000 copies of the book, an undertaking that was documented every Thursday on the LatterGayStories Facebook and Instagram pages. https://www.eventcreate.com/e/miracle-of-forgiveness-art Now in its second year, we have collected over 8,000 copies of The Miracle of Forgiveness. On December 31, 2021, Deseret Book quietly deleted the online version of The Miracle of Forgiveness from their platform, thus ending the availability to purchase the book through official LDS sources. Reining since 1969 and selling more than 2,2 million printed and digital copies, the book is now fully discontinued. What do we do with 8,000 copies of The Miracle of Forgiveness? We turn them into art! For the second year in a row, we are inviting artists to create art pieces using reclaimed copies of The Miracle of Forgiveness. The art created from these books tell a story of the its harmful rhetoric and through the art comes healing, progress, and the ability to thrive. JOIN US! September 16, 2023 | 7:00 PM at Trolley Square in Salt Lake City, for the black tie art gala! We will have an open art exhibit displaying the art, a cocktail hour with drinks, hor d\u0027oeuvres, a short program, and a private concert featuring EJ Michels to end the evening. Dust off the formal wear and join us for an awesome night. Tickets are $35 | includes access to the exhibits, drinks, hor d\u0027oeuvres, and the concert!",

      "description": "In this intriguing interview with John Dehlin and Radio Free Mormon, we delve into the contentious topic of Joseph Smith\u0027s polygamy. We start by questioning the need to discuss Smith\u0027s polygamy and encounter neo-fundamentalist Mormons asserting it was a scheme. The 1980s saw the Community of Christ church retracting their stance on Smith\u0027s polygamy. A caller on Mormonism LIVE claims Smith wasn\u0027t a polygamist, raising the pivotal question: Was he truly one? Historians unanimously agree he was.\n Examining contemporary evidence, including the Nauvoo Expositor, we see a mosaic of affidavits and records debunking theories of D\u0026C 132 being a forgery. The interview tackles apologetic tactics in the face of such evidence, uncovering the truth behind Joseph Smith\u0027s complex history. Tune in to unravel the mysteries surrounding Joseph Smith\u0027s polygamy and witness the uncovering of undeniable truths.\n Episode Show Notes\n YouTube Link\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

One possible problem with Ballard\u0027s Mormon-based anti-trafficking advocacy is that the founder of his religion - Joseph Smith - would very possibly qualify by today\u0027s standards as a human trafficker. In today\u0027s episode we use The Nauvoo Expositor - published by LDS Church 1st Presidency Member William Law - as the jumping off point to explore the question: was Joseph Smith involved in human trafficking?

How do sincere seekers often end up with different answers when appealing to \u0022the Spirit\u0022? Can individuals be exploited by circumstances deliberately designed to create feelings of spiritual confirmation? What are the consequences when \u0022spiritual witnesses\u0022 go wrong?\n Join us as we dive into the psychological phenomena of spiritual witnesses. We examine topics such as indoctrination, repetition, and the Illusory Truth effect, as well as other psychological mechanisms like confirmation bias, the backfire effect, and motivated reasoning.

      "description": "Sometimes we find ourselves involved in organizations, governments and communities that might be psychologically unhealthy to us or our communities. John Larsen has collected a few points you can use to check to see if an organization might be considered dangerous or unhealthy.\n  There are elections with only one candidate up for each office. All members are expected to vote in unison. The term \u201Cbeloved\u201D is applied to a living leader by other leaders of the organization. Loyal members calling for reform or change are purged or otherwise silenced. There are no means for membership to appeal a decision. The group is willing to break up families or other social structures to further or preserve its own organizations. Members are encouraged to look and dress the same. Uniformity is encouraged or required in clothing, haircuts, jewelry, etc. Life events are controlled by the organization. For example, you cannot marry without leadership approval. There is an organizationally controlled media including television, radio and newspapers. All outside media is cast as suspect. The organization is overly focused on winning over vulnerable populations such as the youth, those who are grieving, or those in financial distress. The group is involved in many business or monetary transactions wholly unrelated to the central mission of the organization. Members are encouraged or required to never say anything negative about the leadership. The organization uses litigation as a means to silence dissident membership or outside organizations speaking against the group. Community leaders are chosen by the central organization. Local communities have no say in who their representatives will be. The governance structure of the central organization is ambiguous, hidden or unknown. Obedience to the central organization is encouraged over all other values. All finances are kept secret. The leadership of the organization is preoccupied with the most intimate details of member\u2019s lives including finances, sex and personal relationships. Leadership tends to speak of the victim-hood of the organization even in endeavors where the organization has a majority or controlling influence. Organizational history is overly sentimentalized and unflattering information is edited out of official documents. The organization insists that it has primacy or is more important than all other organizations. The group has an almost obsessive focus on the outward appearances of organizational buildings and properties, grass is meticulously cut, no litter is ever found, grounds are always perfect. A great deal of time and effort is spent on this resource.  Episode Show Notes\n YouTube Link\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

She discusses the disparities in church policies and teachings that caused her to question her faith and ultimately led her down the rabbit hole of learning about the history of Mormonism. Janae talks candidly about exploring her sexuality and finding new rituals and practices to connect and uplift her after leaving the church. Her story is a powerful testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the possibilities for happiness and health after leaving a religious institution.\n Episode Show Notes\n YouTube Link\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

      "description": "In this emotional and gripping interview, Janae Thompson shares her journey as a Mormon woman and the struggles she faced in a religion that demanded perfection and conformity. From her early years in the Mormon church, to her time at BYU and beyond, Janae recounts the challenges of fitting into a narrow mold while dealing with her own personal struggles, including an eating disorder and the pressure to find an eternal companion. But it was the sudden death of her husband Grant that truly tested Janae\u2019s strength and resilience. Through her raw and honest reflections, Janae offers a powerful insight into loss, grief, and the search for meaning and purpose in the face of tragedy.\n Episode Show Notes\n YouTube Link\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

      "description": "Lance and Brandee Heppler began to question and ultimately leave the Mormon Church after their son Lake experienced mismanagement and mistreatment during his missionary training and service. This experience, along with their daughter Darby coming out as gay and being rejected by the Church, led them to start questioning Church teachings and practices. They also began to educate themselves about Church history and controversies through sources like the \u0022Mormons \u0026 Masons\u0022 documentary, \u0022Mormon Stories,\u0022 and the CES Letter.\n Further cracks in their faith emerged when Brandee became aware of a child abuse incident at their local stake center that had been covered up by Church leaders. Despite these concerns, the Hepplers continued to attend Church and pretend to believe for a time. However, they eventually reached a breaking point and decided to leave the Church altogether. They found that prioritizing their family and their own happiness outside of the Church was more important than following Church rules and teachings that were not serving them.\n Episode Show Notes\n Youtube link\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

      "description": "Join Lance and Brandee Heppler as they share their personal journeys in Mormonism and delve into mental health challenges they faced as they tried to be good Mormon parents. In this episode, Lance talks about his orthodox upbringing in Oregon, serving his mission in South Carolina, and his panic of finding someone to marry before graduating from BYU. Meanwhile, Brandee shares her struggle of not fitting in at church due in part to her parents being converts and her undiagnosed ADHD, making her wonder why it seemed God made her too \u0022rowdy\u0022 as a woman instead of more subdued and \u0022proper\u0022.\n Together they navigate the traditional gender roles expected of them as a married couple in the church while raising young children and serving in various callings. As they grapple with issues such as feminism and LGBTQ issues in the church, they also confront their own mental health struggles and the lack of support from the Mormon community. They share powerful insights about the often transactional nature of Mormon relationships and the harmful effects that come from some teachings that associate mental health struggles with sin. This episode is a must-listen for anyone seeking a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by those raised in Mormonism and the impact it can have on mental health.\n Episode Show Notes\n Youtube link\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

      "description": "Martine and Stuart Smith are back in part three to discuss experiencing the \u201Cheavy hand\u201D of Priesthood Authority from their Stake President; from false teachings affecting lives, being told not to watch a specific show he didn\u2019t like, making youth \u201Ccovenant\u201D to go on missions and never date non-Mormons, only to see him be released and excommunicated for embezzlement. Martine had previously sympathized with the Stake President, who was sometimes unemployed and had five children. She later found out that he had put her membership status as \u201Con probation\u201D though she had never been notified as per policy, and that she had been \u201Cblacklisted\u201D from certain callings. The couple began attending Sunstone, where they explored the gray areas of life and Mormon feminism.\n During this time, they began to question the Church\u0027s teachings, including the Plan of Salvation, which involved separating families more than bringing them together. They also researched the lives of polygamous women and the Equal Rights Amendment. Stuart, an intellectual, was called into the bishopric as an unorthodox member. They stayed in the Church for its utility, but also for their son\u0027s sake. Martine became the RS Pres during the Sept Six Era, a time of more progressive leaders and scholars at BYU and at Women\u0027s Conferences and in leadership.\n Eventually the walls crack on their belief and Martine and Stuart find they can no longer stay in a church that goes against their values.\n Episode Show Notes\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

      "description": "Martine \u0026 Stuart have their first child, Nathaniel, who was diagnosed with Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB), a rare, painful, and ultimately fatal genetic skin condition. Caring for a child with EB is an immense emotional toll on them due to the constant pain the baby suffers with basic daily tasks like feeding \u0026 changing diapers. This episode delves further into the contradictions and complexities of Mormon doctrine around reproduction which made it difficult for Martine and Stuart to come to terms with Nathaniel\u0027s condition. They felt guilt and self-blame upon his diagnosis, questioning whether it was punishment for wanting to wait to have children, or due to a \u0022Saturday\u0027s Warrior\u0022 type pact agreed to in the pre-existence. The doctrine of pre-mortal decisions and the effects on disabilities was also discussed, along with the contradictory messages about disabled or sick children and those who die before accountability.\n As Nathaniel\u0027s condition worsened, the couple sought healing through priesthood blessings, but were met with disappointment when they didn\u0027t work. John discusses expectations vs. the reality of priesthood blessings and the theological justifications used when they don\u0027t work. The couple eventually came to accept the idea of letting Nathaniel go, and he passed away. Martine \u0026 Stuart describe the emotional aftermath of Nathaniel\u0027s death, including the funeral and how Mormons deal with death.\n Despite some trepidation, the couple decides to have another child, which was met with mixed reactions from their community. Martine became pregnant again and gave birth to a healthy son. They later moved to Louisiana, where they became involved in their LDS branch and had a third child, Sarah, who was also born with EB. The episode discusses the routine of care for Sarah and the support they received from their branch. The second death of an infant affected their faith, with Stuart becoming angry at God and turning down a leadership position in the church. Despite this, Martine still wanted more children, and the episode ends with the couple meeting with a General Authority to discuss the deaths of their children and birth control.\n \n\n Episode Show Notes\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

She eventually made it to the United States to attend General Conference and get her Patriarchal Blessing when her sister decided to serve a mission. Due to connections with several families of missionaries, she finds a job as a nanny and eventually makes it to BYU where she is reintroduced to Stuart, whom she\u0027d briefly met as a missionary in Belgium.\n Though he hadn\u0027t known her well, Stuart instantly recognized Martine at a Young Single Adult (YSA) activity and things took off from there until he asked her to be with him for eternity. Martine happily accepts this proposal from an established, generational Mormon returned missionary. However, the engagement is soon jeopardized by challenges between Martine\u0027s desire to follow the brethren\u0027s admonitions not to put off having children (and wanting a dozen of them!) as the quintessential Mormon housewife with Stuart\u0027s practicality regarding his ability to financially support children while still having several years of school left.\n Episode Show Notes\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

Other failed prophecies discussed include the failed treasure seeking mission to Salem and the failed attempt to sell the Book of Mormon copyright.\n Was Joseph wrong or is it was God\u0027s fault?

Jill talks about the superiority you can feel as a Mormon and the cognitive dissonance she experienced when her sister, Alli, came out as a lesbian.

They discuss the complications of navigating family dynamics and the difficulty of leaving the church. Ultimately, the Durrant family\u0027s story is one of resilience, growth, and learning to navigate the complexities of life within and outside of Mormonism.\n Episode Show Notes\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

      "description": "Dallin Seely from YouTube channel @TheDashleys grew up as a multigenerational Mormon. When he was seven years old, his father passed away from stomach cancer. Despite this tragedy, the church provided a lot of support to him and his family. The early death of his father leads Dallin to experience intense scrupulosity as he worries that he will never see his father again in heaven if he isn\u0027t \u0022worthy\u0022 according to LDS Standards. A strict Bishop exacerbates Dallin\u2019s scrupulosity but is somewhat alleviated when a new bishop tells him that his worthiness was not determined by others. When he came home from his mission, he was encouraged to get married, but he continued to have doubts about the church\u0027s teachings, such as the priesthood ban for black members.\u00A0\n Dallin felt the Holy Ghost told him to marry a certain woman, but he falls in love with Ashley, another faithful woman but who seems a bit less \u0022proper\u0022 to Dallin for things like expressing humor through sarcasm. Dallin follows his own heart and marries Ashley anyway. The couple deals with the church\u2019s inherent sexism, including in the temple and the teaching of \u201Cthe patriarchal order\u201D in the Mormon church. Continuous marriage struggles lead them to seek therapy. This led to the healthiest time in their marriage, as they were able to have emotional intimacy and talk about their feelings, including Ashley\u0027s feelings about General Conferences and sexism. They did not want to teach their daughter to feel inferior to men. Dallin and Ashley tell how they learned to embrace their true selves and how they are raising their children in a way that eliminates guilt and fear.\u00A0\n TheDashleys on YouTube\n Ashley Dallin Films\n \n Thedashleys (@thedashleys) | TikTok\n The Dashleys (@thedashleys) \u2022 Instagram photos and videos\n Episode Show Notes\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

When she joined the Bravo show in 2019, she realized her move to quietly quit the faith would become very loud. - The New York Times\n  Heather Gay visits John and Margi in studio and brings along a familiar face for fans of Mormon Stories and The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City, Dre Robinson! Heather tells the story of how her memoir, Bad Mormon, came to be, the challenges she faced to write and publish it (and trademark it), her hopes for the future and what she and Dre are working on now.\n From the publisher:\n  Between attending orthodox services, embarking on an eighteen-month mission, attending Brigham Young University, and marrying into a \u0022royal\u0022 family, Heather was the definition of a \u0022good Mormon.\u0022 However, when the doting wife\u0027s husband unexpectedly filed for divorce, she was left out in the cold by her church and her community.

      "description": "Co-host: Nemo the Mormon\n Stephen Bullivant holds professorial positions at St Mary\u0027s University, London, and the University of Notre Dame, Sydney. He has doctorates in theology (Oxford, 2009) and sociology (Warwick, 2019). His studies of contemporary nonreligiosity have received wide international coverage, including from the BBC, New York Times, Economist, Financial Times, and Der Spiegel.\n The United States is in the midst of a religious revolution. Or, perhaps it is better to say a non-religious revolution. Around a quarter of US adults now say they have no religion. The great majority of these religious \u0022nones\u0022 also say that they used to belong to a religion but no longer do. These are the nonverts: think \u0022converts,\u0022 but from having religion to having none. There are currently has about 59 million of them in the United States.\n Nonverts explores who they are, and why they joined the rising tide of the ex-religious. One of world\u0027s leading experts on contemporary atheism and nonreligiosity, sociologist and theologian Stephen Bullivant draws on dozens of interviews, original analysis of high-quality survey data, and a wealth of cutting-edge studies, to present an entertaining and insightful exploration of America\u0027s ex-religious landscape. Bullivant criss-crosses the country, talking to everyone from ex-Mormons in Utah to ex-Catholics in Pennsylvania, from ex-Evangelicals in Georgia to ex-Muslims in California, showing not only what they have in common but also how the traditions they left behind continue to shape them.\n While American religion is not going to die out any time soon, ex-Christian America is a growing presence in national life. America\u0027s religious revolution is not just a religious revolution--it is catalyzing a profound social, cultural, moral, and political impact. Nonverts will serve as an indispensable guide to this shifting landscape, as well as the future of American life.\n Join John and Nemo as they dive deeper into just why it is that people leave the LDS church.\n Nonverts: The Making of Ex-Christian America\n Episode Show Notes\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

This will be a 3-part series of Channel\u2019s story.\n Channel is continuing her story from her marriage, an embarrassing disciplinary council where she is judged for her \u201Csins\u201D by a group entirely of white men, and dealing with the fall-out of a marriage that was ill-suited from the beginning and facing the stigma of divorce within the LDS church as a woman of color. Channel marries again, this time to a non-member of the church and has two children. Despite her husband\u2019s encouragement to leave, Channel continues to seek acceptance and approval from her religion despite her skin color. As she becomes disillusioned over time, Channel manages to stay in because of the influence of a few good friends, especially when her second marriage dissolves, and she finds herself needing more help.\n We learn more about issues around race issues in general such as the difference between racism and white supremacy and how both show up in the Church\u2019s doctrines, practices, and members, including being constantly talked down to and told what to do with her life and what to think even by friends over a decade younger than she.\n Episode Show Notes\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

This will be a 3-part series of Channel\u2019s story.\n In Part 1 We get some background on Channel\u2019s family growing up, how black families and black culture differ substantially from Mormon white culture, what led Channel to seek God and how that led to her joining the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Channel tells us the good, bad \u0026 ugly of how she was treated as a black teenage convert, when she learned of the Church\u2019s racism, and ways that she accepted, excused, and eventually internalized it to see herself as \u201Cless\u201D than her white counterparts.\n This became most apparent in dating and marriage. While white men in the church may find her exotic and are willing to date her, Channel finds that they are unwilling to marry her as \u201Cmixing seed\u201D would pass her \u201Ccurse\u201D [black skin] to children that could otherwise have two white parents. As Channel loses herself and what makes her unique to the cultural expectations of the Church she marries another black member of the church at the counsel of her Bishop against her better judgment.\n Episode Show Notes\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

Driven by a desire to do what\u2019s right and excel, Kelsey develops a perfectionism that goes beyond religious adherence into body image and leads to disordered eating. Kelsey is able to recover with help from her parents, only to be thrown into another family crisis as her father succumbs to an opiate addiction after chronic back pain and leaves both the Church and the family. As many children do, Kelsey feels she shares blame for the destruction of her family and re-commits to the LDS religion for strength and comfort.\u00A0\n When her family moves to Provo, Utah, Mormon purity culture has costs for Kelsey\u2019s self-esteem and body image as she continues pursuing performance at high school and BYU. Kelsey\u2019s first doubts come as she serves a mission in Birmingham Alabama and grapples with the spirituality and fulfillment members of other faiths feel. Kelsey realizes belief in \u201Ceternal families\u201D is far from unique to Mormonism but what IS unique about the Mormon version is the dark element that it\u2019s predicated on a God deliberately separating families first.\n\nJoin us for the rest in Part 2!\n Social Media:\n  New Song: Life in a Box Insta: www.instagram.com/kelseymarieedwards TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@kelseymarieedwards YouTube.com/@kelseyedwards Kelsey Edwards on IMDB  Squad Goals: Courses.kelseyedwards.co (For teen girls about making/keeping good friends)\u00A0\n Episode Show Notes\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

Over the course of succeeding decades, this practice became more severe, constituting a wrenching removal from the community. Gaining readmittance often required intense penance and evidence of significant change stretching over a prolonged period of time. Sometimes this process even involved the leaders\u0027 colleagues.

      "description": "When Douglas Stilgoe, AKA \u0022Nemo the Mormon\u0022 on YouTube, no longer felt he could publicly sustain Mormonism\u0027s top leadership of apostles \u0026 prophets due to multiple acts of demonstrable dishonesty, he lost one of Mormonism\u0027s highest privileges: the ability to attend the Temple.\n For Mormons, Temple worship goes FAR beyond religious ceremony. It is the gate by which believing Mormons qualify for Exaltation, the highest level of Heaven \u0026 privilege in the after-life according to Mormon theology, and by which marriages \u0026 family relationships are \u0022sealed\u0022 together for eternity. Thus, losing the privilege of Temple worship doesn\u0027t just risk an individual\u0027s OWN eternal reward, but also puts one\u0027s eternal marriage and other family ties in jeopardy, some even to the extent of believing that faithful spouses and children will be \u0022reassigned\u0022 to a faithful stranger who will replace the unbelieving spouse or parent in Heaven.\n It is also synonymous with personal \u0022worthiness\u0022, so any Mormons not permitted inside are often thought to be committing or in the process of repenting from egregious sins, such as adultery. Mormons who are not considered \u0022worthy\u0022 to perform Temple ordinances themselves are also barred from even attending ordinances - like weddings - of any friends and family that take place there, another significant source of pain and alienation for some.\n Naturally, Doug found it problematic that for believing Mormons, such important things as Exaltation and Eternal Family can be held hostage and denied for something as simple as refusing to agree to sustain leaders who, by virtue of a supposedly secret ordinance known as the \u0022Second Anointing,\u0022 are exempt from any accountability towards members of the Church, even for bold, deliberate acts of harm and dishonesty.\n ...or are they?\n This episode documents attempts made by Doug (Nemo) to get to the bottom of whether Mormon doctrines \u0026 practices meant to instill accountability from its earliest days and scripture are still applicable today, or whether they\u0027ve become mere ritual, devoid of any meaningful significance other than virtue-signaling conformity and a continued commitment to blind obedience. As a squeaky wheel unable to be assuaged or silenced by local leadership, Nemo surprises everyone (including himself) when he manages to bypass the usual gatekeepers and break through the glass ceiling separating Mormonism\u0027s apostles and prophets from the rank-and-file, successfully garnering the attention of none other than second highest-ranking apostle and next in line to become prophet, Dallin H. Oaks.\n How did it go? Tune it to find out!\n Nemo the Mormon YouTube Channel\n  \u0022Evidence of Dishonesty\u0022 - Nemo\u0027s document (coming soon!)

      "description": "In this Part 2 of 3, we return to Jeff \u0026 Larissa\u0027s story. Now married, Larissa gives up her University Studies to help Jeff through Med school. They share their struggles with infertility, the adoption process, and adopting black children as orthodox Mormons.\n \u00A0\n Larissa faces difficulties in early motherhood and building resentment as they settle into traditional LDS gender roles. Larissa feels she is losing herself wrapped up in her husband\u0027s life, while at the same time trying to silence that part of her that is unhappy, seeing it as \u0022wrong.\u0022\n \u00A0\n Larissa is called as a RS President, even as she becomes more vocally progressive/feminist and has hope for the Church to change, but it doesn\u0027t last.\n \u00A0\n Jeff realizes the Gospel can\u0027t fix Larissa\u0027s unhappiness as the root cause is Patriarchy. He serves in Bishoprics for 7 years before discovering more about Church history from the CES Letter, and Rough Stone Rolling, with the Gospel Topics Essays being the final straw.\n \u00A0\n Jeff \u0026 Larissa finally recognize the level of harm of systemic racism \u0026 sexism in Mormonism and no longer wish to be a part of it.\n \u00A0\n Larissa Kindred\n  Instagram: @lkindred Twitter: @exmo_mama  Jeff Kindred:\n  Twitter: @jeff_kindred\u00A0  Episode Show Notes\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

Jeff\u0027s story includes a grooming scoutmaster, his love of sports, attending Snow College, and serving a mission in Jackson, Mississippi where he dealt with scrupulosity, unhealthy diet and exercise, becoming AP, and wrestling with racism in the Church culture \u0026 scripture.\n Larissa\u0027s story involves her Japanese-American heritage, and gives a brief introduction on the history of anti-Japanese sentiment in Utah, including having been home to a Japanese \u0022Work\u0022 Camp in Topaz. Larissa tells of the struggles her grandparents faced assimilating into Utah Culture and dealing with the loss of their own. Larissa also describes racism she experienced growing up in American Fork, UT and Mormon culture\u0027s ideals matching white beauty standards.\n And this is just the beginning! Jeff and Larissa have a lot of experiences that many current and former Mormons will relate to and experiences that will be new for many to hear.\n Larissa Kindred\n  Instagram: @lkindred Twitter: @exmo_mama  Jeff Kindred:\n  Twitter: @jeff_kindred\u00A0  Episode Show Notes\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

      "description": "Join us for two unique Mormon Stories as John Dehlin \u0026 Samantha Shelley interview Tommy \u0026 Madison Johnson. Tommy made fans and haters on both sides of belief when he hit the TikTok scene during COVID with funny skits on the peculiarities of Mormonism. What viewers couldn\u0027t see was that Tommy was struggling to know how to deal with many of the messier topics in Church History as well as the darker sides of modern Mormon doctrines such as the stance against the LGBTQ\u002B community, which includes his own sister, while ALSO navigating his mixed-faith marriage with Madison who stopped believing entirely after their Temple Marriage. Madison describes her life as having been \u0022born into a faith crisis\u0022 due to stigma and family shame around being conceived out of wedlock by a teen mother. Madison\u0027s struggles with the faith continued through most of her life despite her levels of activity/involvement in the Church, even through her Temple Marriage with Tom. Madison leaves the Church upon finding the CES letter and she and Tommy work through what this will mean for their marriage, and even end up on an episode of the podcast \u0022Marriage on a Tightrope\u0022 with Katie \u0026 Allan Mount. They finish off with where the couple is at today and how life is going since all of the changes they\u0027ve been through.

Mike sets up the historical \u0026 personal context of the timing of this revelation and the problematic ideas presented in it as coming from God including how God views women, redefining adultery and other moral issues, and the various rules and justifications given by God to practice polygamy.\u00A0\n Mike goes on to show that Joseph admits himself that polygamy is something he wanted, and despite being the receiver of the various specific rules defined by God, he nevertheless proceeds to break every one of them.\u00A0\n Finally, Mike goes over the many apologetics around this section of the Doctrine \u0026 Covenants and the problems with most of the arguments attempting to justify the revelation, Joseph\u2019s polygamy, and the resulting polygamy among many of the branches of Mormonism, some continuing to this day.\u00A0\n Special Guest: Elisha Lee\n  Faith Unraveled Tiktok (Faith Transition Focused) Soul Unraveled Tiktok (Personal Journey Focused)  LDS Discussion Essay on Polygamy\n Episode Show Notes\n LDS Discussions 6-Part Series on Polygamy:\n  Part 1: An Introduction to Mormon Polygamy - 24 Part 3: Joseph Smith\u2019s Plural Marriage Proposals Pt 1 \u2013 26 Part 4: Joseph Smith\u2019s Plural Marriage Proposals Pt 2 \u2013 27 Part 5: The Happiness Letter (Joseph Smith\u2019s Proposition to Nancy Rigdon) \u2013 28 Part 6: Polygamy Apologetics, Spiritual Wifery, etc \u2013 29  \u00A0\n  _________________________\n LDS Discussions is made possible by generous donors!\n Help us continue to deliver quality content by becoming a donor today:\n  One-time or recurring donation through Donorbox Support us on Patreon Pick \u201CMormon Stories\u201D as your charity on Amazon Smile or through the Amazon App  LDS Discussions Platforms:\n  LDS Discussions Website LDS Discussions Playlist on YouTube  Contact LDS Discussions:\n  Twitter: @ldsdicussions Facebook: @ldsdiscussion Insta: @ldsdiscussions Email: ldsdiscussions@gmail.com  Contact us:\n MormonStories@gmail.com\n PO Box 171085, Salt Lake City, UT 84117\n Social Media:\n  Insta: @mormstories Tiktok: @mormonstoriespodcast Join the Discord",

      "description": "Evan Smith rose through the ranks of Mormon leadership ultimately becoming a Stake Presidency member. While serving as an LDS Bishop, Evan struggled with the Church\u2019s positions on LGBTQ\u002B issues and later found out that his son Weston was gay. Even after coming out, Weston decided to serve an LDS Mission as an openly gay man, leading him to high levels of depression and heartbreaking experiences during and after coming back early from his mission.\n Evan became an advocate for LGBTQ people in the Church. His position as a Stake Presidency Counselor led him to a few confrontations/discussions with General Authorities and a later meeting at Church Headquarters where they discussed Evan\u2019s progressive beliefs on LGBTQ matters. Join John and Gerardo as they interview Evan and his son Weston about their fascinating Mormon Story.\u00A0\n \n In Part 1 of 3, we learn of Evan\u2019s relatively normal LDS (Mormon) upbringing in Utah, early testimony-building experiences, and troubling issues on his mission regarding difficult Church topics including the Church\u2019s racism \u0026 homophobia. Evan attends BYU and meets his wife, Cheryl, and works through law school with three children. He becomes a Branch President (leader of a local congregation-similar to a Bishop, but over a smaller congregation) and begins learning Gospel teachings and experiences weren\u2019t as simple as they initially seemed, culminating in his son, Weston, coming out to him as gay.\n  Gay Latter-day Saint Crossroads This Body of Water: Surviving Mormonism as a Queer Man\u00A0   Episode Show Notes\n =====\n Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

The doctrinal basis for the early Mormon ban against black people worshiping and marrying in the Temple, as well as the ban against black Mormon men from receiving the Priesthood, the authority needed to hold any leadership position in the Church as well as perform essential saving ordinances such as baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost etc. The real reasons the Church was pressured to lift the ban and the measures taken to make it happen despite continued vehement opposition among some Church leaders.  1665: Race \u0026 Mormon Scripture Pt 2 w/ LDS Discussions \u2013 22\n LDS Discussions Essay on Race\n Episode Show Notes\n  _________________________\n LDS Discussions is made possible by generous donors!\n Help us continue to deliver quality content by becoming a donor today:\n  One-time or recurring donation through Donorbox Support us on Patreon Pick \u201CMormon Stories\u201D as your charity on Amazon Smile or through the Amazon App  LDS Discussions Platforms:\n  LDS Discussions Website LDS Discussions Playlist on YouTube  Contact LDS Discussions:\n  Twitter: @ldsdicussions Facebook: @ldsdiscussion Insta: @ldsdiscussions Email: ldsdiscussions@gmail.com  Contact us:\n MormonStories@gmail.com\n PO Box 171085, Salt Lake City, UT 84117\n Social Media:\n  Insta: @mormstories Tiktok: @mormonstoriespodcast Join the Discord",

The \u0022code\u0022 that exists within families of LDS General Authorities to never do or say anything to bring dishonor to the family name or church, including speaking out about a loss of faith, which leads many descendants of LDS apostles to lie about and/or hide their loss of faith.

Gospel Tangents is a channel looking to represent a 360 degree view of Mormonism and welcomes guests representing various views and experiences of the Restoration Gospel started by Joseph Smith.\u00A0\n Rick calls John Dehlin the \u0022grandfather\u0022 of Mormon podcasting. Not that he\u0027s old, but rather internet-old! Rick asks John about his journey in and out of the Church, dating an Oscar-winning actress in high school, some of his dealing with general authorities, and his excommunication and aftermath. They also discuss his tangles with apologists \u0026 neo-apologists, the Swedish Rescue, and whether he really wants people to stay LDS.\n \n\n ________\n WE ARE 100% DONOR FUNDED!

      "description": "Join John as he interviews Utah Representative Angela Romero, Lindsey Lundholm, and Dr. Julie Hanks about the upcoming Protect Kids rally, in favor of requiring clergy to report abuse.\n ALL adults across the state, without exception, should be mandated to report child abuse. Representative Angela Romero has championed this legislation over the past two years. She is sponsoring the rally and will be the keynote speaker. Lindsey Lundholm is the grassroots organizer for the Protect Kids rally, and passionate about giving children one more safe line of defense against abuse. As a therapist and member of the LDS faith, Dr. Julie Hanks, stands in support of eliminating the clergy loophole. Please join us at the south steps of the Utah State Capitol this Friday @ 6:30pm. WEAR TEAL in support of SA survivors.\n More details here: https://fb.me/e/2G8FC1foR\n For those unable to attend in person, the event will be streamed live. In case of inclement weather, the event will be held fully online via Facebook live at 6:30pm on Friday, August 19th. Currently in Utah law, clergy are exempt from mandatory reporting of child abuse. Recent news stories have highlighted how this exception can lead to serious harm for children, and a grey area for clergy.\n Let\u2019s make the law clear: protecting children from abuse is the first priority. We are rallying to educate and encourage the state to pass laws that close the clergy loophole. We believe this is the year we can get it passed, to provide a safer Utah for children.\n How you can help in the meantime:\n \uD83D\uDD39 RSVP to the Facebook event, and invite your circle of influence: https://fb.me/e/2G8FC1foR\n \uD83D\uDD39 Follow, like, and share on Instagram @mandateclergyreporting\n \uD83D\uDD39 Sign this petition (40k\u002B signatures): Make LDS Clergy Mandatory Reporters: https://chng.it/6DvQJS5rLF\n \uD83D\uDD39 DM or email us at mandateclergyreporting@gmail.com to lend support, offer to volunteer, etc.\n \uD83D\uDD39 Share your story.

      "description": "Join us as we welcome Jessica Parker to the Thrive Stories podcast to discuss her journey of accepting and finding peace in infertility. As a woman who was raised in a faithful Latter-day Saint home, Jessica absorbed all the messages about the role of women and her divine purpose to bear children. She served a mission, got married in the temple, and gave her time and energy to the church for years. All of this came into question when Jessica began her faith journey--which then led to deconstructing and rebuilding her innate sense of value, identity, and purpose as a human being.\n Thrive Stories is a podcast series where Margi (alongside John or Jenn) interviews a member of the community once per month. The interviews are shorter (2-3 hours), story-based, and are focused on a particular aspect of healing and growth AFTER a Mormon faith crisis (thus the THRIVE name). They generally happen on Tuesdays at noon (MST). Some examples of areas of thriving include: Family Relationships, Healthy Boundaries, Finding Community, Finding Meaning/Purpose, Dealing with Grief/Death, Religion after Mormonism, Health Sexuality, Parenting, Improving Physical Health, Identity, Health Marriage/Relationships, Secular Spirituality, Word of Wisdom 2.0, and Women Finding Their Own Voice after Mormonism.\n If you would like to nominate someone you know who would be a great candidate for a THRIVE interview, please nominate them (or yourself) here.\n WE ARE 100% DONOR FUNDED!

      "description": "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is known globally for its massive missionary force. Over the past year we have received several independent reports suggesting serious distress in the Mormon missionary program, including:\n  A sharp decline in the number of LDS missionaries overall. A sharp decline in the number of young men willing to serve missions. A significant increase in the number of LDS missionaries returning home early. Troubling new rhetoric/teachings from Mormon church leadership suggesting (out of seeming desperation) that Mormon missionary service for young men is mandatory/compulsory.  On Thursday at 4pm (mountain) we will be exploring this issue. If you have any data or stories regarding these (or other) developments regarding Mormon missionary work, please post them as comments below, or email us at: mormonstories@gmail.com and we can include your input in the show (anonymously if requested).

In this episode, we discuss how Ari lost her faith in the church when she realized that it, too was rooted in abuse and lies, and set on excommunicating those who spoke out against those things. In her discovery, she concluded that the church creates toxic family systems and even abuse cycles. Ari and Adam are parents to 9 kids, and are now cycle breakers.\n Show Notes:\n  12 Rules of a dysfunctional narcissistic family:  https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-narcissist-in-your-life/202003/the-12-rules-dysfunctional-narcissistic-family Narcissistic Personality Disorder - Mayo Clinic:  https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcissistic-personality-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20366662 http://Cesletter.org Stronger than the dark book - Cory Reese:  https://www.amazon.com/Stronger-Than-Dark-Relationship-Depression/dp/1736966405 LDS Gospel Topics Essays:  https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/plural-marriage-in-the-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints?lang=eng Jeremy Runnells MS Interview:  https://mormonstories.org/podcast/jeremy-runnells-and-his-letter-to-a-ces-director/ No Man Knows my History - Fawn Brodie:  https://www.amazon.com/No-Man-Knows-My-History/dp/0679730540 Mormon History Timeline:  https://mormonstories.org/truth-claims/chronology-of-mormon-history/ Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents: How to Heal from Distant, Rejecting, or Self-Involved Parents:  https://www.amazon.com/Adult-Children-Emotionally-Immature-Parents/dp/1626251703 Educated - Tara Westover:  https://www.amazon.com/Educated-Memoir-Tara-Westover/dp/0399590501 Tara Westover MS interviews (there are 2): https://mormonstories.org/podcast/tara-westover/ Recovering Agency:  https://www.amazon.com/Recovering-Agency-Lifting-Mormon-Control/dp/1489595937 The BITE model:  https://freedomofmind.com/the-bite-model-and-religious-cult-groups/  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n WE ARE 100% DONOR FUNDED!

Just when Linda Barney thought she had the perfect life planned for her family, she discovered that letting her kids be exactly who they are and loving them unconditionally was a far happier and healthier path to follow than the one she had always been taught to believe in. Join us for this compelling Thrive Stories episode about Parenting LGBTQIA children.\n \u00A0\n Thrive Stories is a new podcast series where Margi (alongside John or Jenn) will be interviewing a member of the community twice per month.\u00A0 The interviews will be shorter (1-2 hours), story-based, but will be focused on a particular aspect of healing and growth AFTER a Mormon faith crisis (thus the THRIVE name).\u00A0 They will happen on Tuesdays at noon (MST). Some examples of areas of thriving include:\u00A0 Family Relationships, Healthy Boundaries, Finding Community, Finding Meaning/Purpose, Dealing with Grief/Death, Religion after Mormonism, Health Sexuality, Parenting, Improving Physical Health, Identity, Health Marriage/Relationships, Secular Spirituality, Word of Wisdom 2.0, and Women Finding Their Own Voice after Mormonism.\n \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n WE ARE 100% DONOR FUNDED!

Hinckley, and the daughter of Oliver Preston Robinson and Christine Hinckley Robinson.\u00A0 Christine\u0027s father, Preston or \u0022Pres\u0022 was a prominent professor of advertising a the University of Utah, general manager of the Deseret News Publishing Company and editor of the Deseret News, and a personal mentor to the late Mormon prophet Thomas S. Monson.\u00A0 Preston was mentioned seven different times in the LDS Church-approved biography of Thomas S. Monson.\n In Christine\u0027s heartbreaking and inspiring story, she relates several tragic Mormon-related stories, including:\n  Experiencing psychological, physical and sexual abuse at the hands of her parents. Feeling deep confusion trying to reconcile her parents\u0027 abuse with her own self-worth, given that her parents/family were publicly lauded on multiple occasions by several Mormon prophets as being exemplary.\u00A0 This included her father being called as mission president in England, and both of her parents receiving their Second Anointing after the abuse. Her attempts to tell both Gordon B. Hinckley and Thomas S. Monson (as sitting prophets/apostles) about the abuse she experienced at the hands of her parents - wherein she was told by both that she needed to \u0022put it behind her.\u0022 The death by suicide of her gay son. Her loss of Mormon faith. Her commitment to helping others heal and grow after Mormonism.  We hope you find value in this heartbreaking and inspiring episode.\n Show Notes:\n  O.

With audio recordings of phone calls, meetings, and the Disciplinary Council itself, we will show the constant misrepresentations, deflections, and gaslighting perpetrated by the Bishop and the Stake President to protect the good name of the church. A modern case of lying for the Lord. After moving out of his home-Stake, not attending church for 4 years, and 6 months after posting on Facebook about getting married to the love of his life, Brennen was handed a letter at his door. He was utterly stunned and confused as he read the document signed by his childhood bishop who was summoning him to a Disciplinary Council on the basis of his same-sex marriage. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 We are 100% donor funded!

      "description": "Teal Swan is a highly controversial New Age guru with millions of online followers.\u00A0 Teal specifically markets her services to vulnerable, often suicidal individuals, and advances highly controversial and/or damaging beliefs and techniques including:\n  Encouraging graphic suicidal ideation. Nurturing false memories and false accusations of ritual abuse by family members through thoroughly debunked recovered memory techniques. Waterboarding as a trauma treatment. Downplaying the severity of death by suicide by likening it to \u201Chitting the reset button\u201D into a future reincarnated life.  Teal\u2019s practices are covered more thoroughly in the recently released Hulu series entitled \u201CThe Deep End.\u201D Several deaths by suicide have been attributed to Teal\u2019s practices.\n In today\u2019s episode we interview Diana Hansen Ribera, who was one of Teal\u2019s closest childhood and adolescent friends.\u00A0 In her interview, Diana provides thorough detail to challenge Teal\u2019s false claims of being a victim of satanic ritual abuse and sex trafficking as a child, and explains how Teal developed her coercion skills and harmful techniques with Diana \u2014 that Teal would eventually employ on a broader scale.\n Warning: This interview contains graphic and disturbing content.\u00A0 Viewer and listener discretion is advised.\n Show Notes:\n  Zelph on the Shelf YT channel  Zelph on the Shelf MS episode  The Deep End Hulu Series  MS Satanic Ritual Abuse episode Jared Dobson MS episode  The Gateway podcast episode on Teal BBC Episode on Teal Teal\u2019s interview by Idaho journalist Girl, Interrupted movie  You\u2019re Wrong About podcast Human trafficking episode  Remembering Satan Book Diana\u0027s Email: DianaTellsHerTruth@gmail.com  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n We are 100% donor funded!

      "description": "Join Margi and John for our next episode of Thrive Stories tomorrow, Tuesday May 24th, at noon (MST). Marc Oslund will be joining us in the studio! Marc spent most of his young adult life and the entirety of his time in the Mormon church trying to fit in. After converting to Mormonism, Marc\u2019s tendency to be hard on himself grew into scrupulosity--a form of religious OCD that made his self-worth plummet. Marc began to believe that he was never good enough--a belief that took a steep toll on his mental health. After years of suffering, Marc acquired skills that aligned with principles of innate worth, shame resilience, mindfulness, self-compassion that allowed him to overcome his scrupulosity. This episode conveys Marc\u2019s experience ending the hustle to find worth and the lessons learned in the process of coming home to himself.\n Disclaimer: although Marc is a mental health professional and therapeutic principles are conveyed in this episode, this not meant to be considered mental health treatment or professional advice.\n Thrive Stories is a new podcast series where Margi (alongside John or Jenn) will be interviewing a member of the community twice per month. The interviews will be shorter (1-2 hours), story-based, but will be focused on a particular aspect of healing and growth AFTER a Mormon faith crisis (thus the THRIVE name). They will happen on Tuesdays at noon (MST). Some examples of areas of thriving include: Family Relationships, Healthy Boundaries, Finding Community, Finding Meaning/Purpose, Dealing with Grief/Death, Religion after Mormonism, Health Sexuality, Parenting, Improving Physical Health, Identity, Health Marriage/Relationships, Secular Spirituality, Word of Wisdom 2.0, and Women Finding Their Own Voice after Mormonism. If you would like to nominate someone you know who would be a great candidate for a THRIVE interview, please nominate them (or yourself) HERE.\n Show Notes:\n  Marc\u2019s MS series Scrupulosity MS Episodes:  Understanding Mormon Scrupulosity  John Dehlin Scrupulosity  ment-therapy-with-john-dehlin/  Hannah Comeau   Lance Allred MS episodes  Redefining masculinity with Lance Allred Tattoos on the Heart Greg Boyle Book Series Brene Brown Book Series Secular Buddhism  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n We are 100% donor funded!

      "description": "Since the founding of Mormonism in 1830 there has been a core belief in the imminent 2nd coming of Jesus Christ (thus the \u0022Latter-day Saints\u0022 portion of the Mormon church\u0027s official name). Within modern Mormonism over the past few decades there has been an increasing trend towards \u0022end times\u0022 preparedness - wherein ultra-orthodox Mormons begin preparing for the 2nd coming of Jesus by selling their 401k\u0027s and retirement plans, moving to rural areas, attending \u0022Prepper\u0022 conferences like \u0022Preparing a People,\u0022 building fortresses, stockpiling food/weapons/ammunition/tents/trailers, denying traditional health care to children, etc., and preparing (i.e., \u0022prepping\u0022) for the arrival of Jesus. This movement has been at best benign (for a few), but for many has led to extreme behaviors, divided families, financial ruin, a host of emerging \u0022prophets\u0022 (e.g., charlatans) who prey on this mentality (e.g., Julie Rowe), and in some cases murder (e.g., Chad Daybell and Lori Vallow story).\n Emma was raised in a Mormon Prepper household. In Part 3 of our 3-part series with Emma, she discusses \u0022coming out\u0022 as lesbian while as BYU student, and how her emerging LGBTQ identity, along with family rejection and problems with her family\u0027s \u0022Prepper\u0022 beliefs, led her to lose faith in the Mormon church, and to become alienated from her orthodox Mormon family.\n Show Notes:\n  \u0022LGBTQ students at BYU light up the \u0027Y\u0027 in rainbow colors,\u0022 by Courtney Tanner, Salt Lake Tribune, March 5, 2021 \u0022A Bishop\u0027s Family Questions Mormonism,\u0022 Kelly and Kayla Mikesell on Mormon Stories Cultish podcast \u0022Coming Out as a Non-Believer to Family Members,\u0022 Gift of the Mormon Faith Crisis Encircle: Utah Resources for LGBTQ\u002B Youth \u0022Elder Jeffrey R.

In addition, listen to how Jake has navigated grief and loss in witnessing both the death of his mother and the loss of his community. Jake is now a mental health advocate, studying at the #1 ranked Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner program at Vanderbilt University. He aspires to improve the mental health of populations across the lifespan and in marginalized groups that are struggling with mental illness-- particularly those who have suffered the mental health effects of undue influence, high demand belief systems, abusive family dynamics, and religious trauma.\n Thrive Stories is a new podcast series where Margi (alongside John and Carah) will be interviewing a member of the community twice per month. The interviews will be shorter (1-2 hours), story-based, but will be focused on a particular aspect of healing and growth AFTER a Mormon faith crisis (thus the THRIVE name). They will happen on Tuesdays at noon (MST).

We dive in head-on in this episode hearing about how marriage for these two young Mormons was not what they expected. But with an interesting reframe to spirituality from an LDS therapist, Lizzy and Spencer\u2019s autonomous spirituality began to emerge like never before. After having enough of spiritual gatekeeping and finding a way to make marriage finally work from them, Spencer describes almost being kicked out of BYU and the situation he was put in by a bishop telling him he had one week to read the Book of Mormon or lose his ecclesiastical endorsement. There are too many topics to list that we cover in this epic final episode with Lizzy and Spencer, but among them are: How and why some Mormons decide to supplement LDS church teachings with New Age spirituality, how wearing garments and Mormon body standards affect women, how empathizing with friends in the LGBTQ community can wake a person up to the realities and harms of Mormon doctrine, and so many other great insights and analogies that help describe why a couple would love Mormonism and choose to leave it!\n \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n We are 100% donor funded!

We discuss the moves the local leadership made that shocked them, including praising the former bishop in front of his victims to the entire ward congregation. This is one of the most important stories that highlight the LDS culture of conforming to authority vs following one\u2019s conscience and the fallout of doing the latter. We applaud Kolby and Cami (and other members of their Idaho stake) for trying to protect children and telling this story today.

Our Mormon Stories inbox had an influx of incensed Latter-day Saints across all spectrums of belief last night as Brad Wilcox gave a fireside talk that we\u2019re calling \u201CThe Alpine Utah Mormon Youth Rescue\u201D. Just like the LDS church\u2019s response to the wave of apostasy in 2012 affecting Swedish members, Brad Wilcox, professor of ancient scripture at BYU and second counselor in the Young Men general presidency spoke to the youth February 6th, 2022 in a talk about how leaving the Mormon church means \u201Cyou lose everything that matters\u201D. Join John, Gerardo, and Carah as we play clips and react to Brad explaining his reasons to the youth of the church that those who leave the faith are taking the hardest possible route in life. Other quotes include:\u00A0\n \u0022Maybe instead of asking \u0027why did the blacks have to wait until 1978\u2019, maybe what we should be asking is \u0027why did the whites and other races have to wait until 1829?\u2019\u0022\n \u201CWe are the only Christians in the world led by Christ\u201D\n \u0022When you walk away from this church you lose everything that matters in your life.\u201D\n \n\n Show Notes:\n View our playlist with the full talk on our Understanding Mormonism channel.\u00A0 Individual sections are included below.\u00A0 To download the raw video file click here.\n Grant Palmer\u2019s books\n \u00A0\n \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n We are 100% donor funded!

      "description": "Mormon Stories Listeners/Viewers,\n We are SUPER excited to announce a new project on Mormon Stories Podcast, based on your feedback. Some background: we asked you (the community) for feedback regarding Margi Dehlin\u0027s participation on Mormon Stories, and the feedback we received was that you would value having Margi actually occasionally interview people for Mormon Stories Podcast (with John and Carah supporting of course) - but to still draw on Margi\u0027s wisdom/expertise as a coach.\n So here\u0027s the new project: For the next few months, Margi will be interviewing a member of the community twice per month. The interviews will be shorter (1-2 hours), still story-based, but will be focused on a particular aspect of healing and growth AFTER a Mormon faith crisis (thus the THRIVE name). Some examples of categories include: Family Relationships, Healthy Boundaries, Finding Community, Finding Meaning/Purpose, Dealing with Grief/Death, Religion after Mormonism, Health Sexuality, Parenting, Improving Physical Health, Identity, Health Marriage/Relationships, Secular Spirituality, Word of Wisdom 2.0, and Women Finding Their Own Voice after Mormonism.\n We have set up a form for you to nominate someone who you think would be amazing for Mormon Stories Podcast, or to nominate yourself. If you or someone you know would be a great candidate for a THRIVE interview, please nominate them (or yourself) here.\u00A0 The form gives you the option to upload a video of you or your nominee telling a story.\n Margi will be sifting through these interviews and will reach out to you if you are chosen. Please spread the word! And thank you for the support!!!! Also, feel free to email Margi Dehlin with any questions: margidehlin@gmail.com\n \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n We are 100% donor funded!

      "description": "Mormon Stories listeners are in for a treat today as we\u2019re joined by Mark Phillips and his daughter Zelle as they share their family\u2019s fascinating Mormon journey. Mark is a clinical and counseling psychologist by profession who has spent part of his career working in LDS Family Services and was first inspired on his mission as a trainer to become a psychologist when working with difficult companions. Zelle discusses with us what it was like as a missionary during Covid, coming home early, coming out to her family, and coming into her own authentic self. A few of the themes we cover in this episode are around how growing up in the US Midwest and South shapes Mormon experiences, focusing on what\u2019s inside instead of outside appearances, and coming to terms with Mormon truth claims as a family.

Decades of impassioned discussion began when about a dozen fragments of Smith\u2019s Egyptian papyri, including a facsimile from the Book of Abraham, were found in the New York Metropolitan Museum in 1966. The discovery solved a mystery about the origin of the Egyptian characters that appear in the various manuscript copies of the Book of Abraham from 1835, reproduced from one of the fragments. Some LDS scholars devised arguments to explain what seemed to be clear evidence of Smith\u2019s inability to translate Egyptian. In this book, Dan Vogel not only highlights the problems with these apologetic arguments but explains the underlying source documents in revealing detail and clarity.\n \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n We are 100% donor funded!

Growing up with enormous health challenges, Nate recognized feelings of same-sex attraction early on in their childhood.\n We discuss Nate\u2019s staunch commitment to the Mormon faith, anorexia while serving a mission, and Nate\u2019s decision to confide in a bishop about their feelings for men, leading Nate to a house and a therapist that would change the course of their life.\n Please practice self-care as you listen to this episode as we highlight the unfortunate reality that the practice of conversion therapy and torture to change the sexual orientation of gay Mormons continues still today.\n **Trigger warning on this episode***\n \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n We are 100% donor funded!

We discuss the similarities between NXIVM leader Keith Raniere and Joseph Smith, including secret societies existing within the larger group, and the similar tactics used to control so many people.\n\nSarah and Nippy share which vulnerabilities led them to become involved in NXIVM and once they were in, what tactics were used to get them to ignore red flags and their own instincts, even as far as Sarah allowing herself to be \u201Cbranded\u201D with Keith Raniere\u2019s initials on her skin. How does one \u201Cwake up\u201D after being willing to go so far?\n Sarah and Nippy share their paths to regaining control of their own minds and bodies to face the hard truth about what they used to believe\u2013and how they turn that devastation into a united determination to expose Keith for what he really is to the world. We hope you\u2019ll resonate with Sarah and Nippy\u2019s fascinating and gripping story!\n  Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

In 1844 he claimed to have been appointed to be the successor of Joseph Smith as leader of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite),[a] a faction of the Latter Day Saint movement. Strang testified that he had possession of a letter from Smith naming him as his successor, and furthermore reported that he had been ordained to the prophetic office by an angel. His organization is claimed by his followers to be the sole legitimate continuation of the Church of Christ founded by Joseph Smith fourteen years before.

As the LDS Church has softened its stances and opened the window for \u201Crighteous celibacy,\u201D gay public figures in mixed-orientation marriages have lost popularity and a more nuanced breed of celibate role models has emerged E.g. Charlie Bird and Ben Schilatty.\n In this episode we discuss how these public figures enable the perpetuation of harmful church rhetoric and spiritual trauma towards the LGBTQ community, and explore some possible solutions that could help ignite positive change in the church.\n Show notes:\n  Mormon Stories\u0027 interview with Gerardo Sumano Mormon Stories\u0027 interview with Kyle Ashworth Tyler\u0027s review of \u201CWithout the Mask\u201D \u201CWithout the Mask: Coming Out and into God\u2019s Light\u201D by Charlie Bird \u0022Coming Out Mormon: An Examination of Religious Orientation, Spiritual Trauma, and PTSD Among Mormon and Ex-Mormon LGBTQQA Adults\u0022 by Brian William Simmons \u0022Navigating Sexual and Religious Identity Conflict: A Mormon Perspective\u0022 by John Dehlin \u201CBeliever\u201D - HBO documentary \u0022Psychosocial Correlates of Religious Approaches to Same-Sex Attraction: A Mormon Perspective\u0022 by John Dehlin \u0022Sexual Orientation Change Efforts, Identity Conflict, and Psychosocial Health Amongst Same-Sex Attracted Mormons\u0022 By John Dehlin \u201CTabernacles of Clay: Sexuality and Gender in Modern Mormonism\u201D by Taylor G.

      "description": "Lauren Rogers is our guest today for this epic two-part Mormon Stories interview. After suffering through a restrictive diet, harassment, and medical neglect on her Mormon mission to Chile, Lauren found herself permanently disabled as she made her way back home to the US.\n In part two, Lauren also tells us about the same-sex attraction she repressed throughout her life as a devout Mormon and descendant of Brigham Young, eventually leading to an extremely fascinating exit from the church and a wildly eye-opening description of how she continues a healthy relationship with her husband.\n It\u2019s a gripping story from start to finish! Even Lauren\u2019s shelf breaker and realizations about God might be a first-ever for Mormon Stories! We hope you\u2019ll resonate with Lauren\u2019s incredible, epic story!\n \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n We are 100% donor funded!

      "description": "Are Mormon missionaries who lead tours at historic church sites like those across upstate New York told to teach false information about the church\u2019s founding? Mormon Stories producer and co-host Carah Burrell takes the reins for her second episode as lead interviewer of our guest Camille Jones as we talk with her about serving in Palmyra, New York at the LDS church\u2019s visitor center.\n In part one of our two-part interview with Camille, we discuss the narrative the church wants to be forwarded about the church\u2019s founding versus what Camille wishes she would have known while volunteering as a full-time missionary. We cover topics from the golden plates, to the Hill Cumorah, and more. Camille also discusses the confusing and uncomfortable advances older Mormon men have made on her throughout her teen years.\n This eye-opening experience highlighted the power imbalance between Mormon men and women, a theme that carries on into part 2 where Camille discusses being employed by the church.\n Show notes:\n  Ghost of Eternal Polygamy by Carol Lynn Pearson What Progressive Mormons Want with Julienna Viegas-Haws  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n We are 100% donor funded!

Matt\u0027s speech received very positive national media attention, including an appearance on the Ellen Show. Matt is currently attending U.C. Berkeley as a Political Science Ph.D. student.\n Last week, Mormon apostle Jeffrey R. Holland publicly \u0022called out\u0022 Matt Easton, accusing him of \u0022commandeering\u0022 the 2019 graduation ceremony. His exact words were:\n \u0022If a student commandeers a graduation podium intended to represent everyone getting diplomas in order to announce his personal sexual orientation, what might another speaker feel free to announce the next year until eventually anything goes? What might commencement come to mean \u2014 or not mean \u2014 if we push individual license over institutional dignity for very long? Do we simply end up with more divisiveness in our culture than we already have? And we already have too much everywhere.\u0022\n Please join us on August 29, 2021 at 1:30pm Utah time as Matt Easton shares with us his Mormon story, and responds to Elder Holland\u0027s irresponsible attacks.\n Show Notes:\n  Matt Easton\u0027s Valedictorian address.

      "description": "As most Mormons are just now beginning to learn, Joseph Smith left multiple and varied First Vision accounts that changed dramatically over time. Joseph Smith\u0027s 1st handwritten First Vision account was produced in 1832, and was intentionally hidden from LDS Church members for over a century and a half - primarily because of the many problems it presented to orthodox belief. The \u0022official\u0022 First Vision account that the LDS Church ended up adopting is the 1838 version, which varies in several significant ways from the previous versions - primarily reflecting Joseph Smith\u0027s evolving theological beliefs.\n Join us today as John Larsen analyzes Joseph Smith\u0027s FIRST (1832) handwritten First Vision account, and explores the many difficulties this version presents to modern Mormon faith.\n Show notes:\n  Joseph Smith Papers MormonThink IRR.org Mormon Infographics Letter for my Wife Mormon Stories Really good comparison chart Wilford Wood museum  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n We are 100% donor funded!

This researched caused Simon to lose his faith in Mormonism. He is the author of a book on the subject called \u201CLosing a Lost Tribe.\u201D\n Recently Simon has been studying the declining growth in the worldwide LDS or Mormon church.

Reports began to emerge that as high as 99% of the ICU patients and deceased were not vaccinated from COVID. In addition, the LDS Church First Presidency released a new announcement a few days ago urging members to be vaccinated. This announcement has caused many vaccine-hesitant LDS church members to question their faith in the LDS church, and/or in LDS Church president Russell M. Nelson. The announcement also has spurned several interesting conspiracy theories. There has also been a variety of responses from local LDS bishops, stake presidents, and members - from supportive to unsupportive.\n On August 17th between 9am and 10am mountain time please join us as we assemble a panel of physicians and experts to discuss the status of the COVID vaccine in the U.S., in Utah, and in the LDS Church. The conversation will avoid politics, will be science-based, and we will take questions from the viewing audience.\n Please join us, and please spread the word.\n ---------------\n We are 100% donor funded!

      "description": "Recovering Agency - Examining Mormon Mind Control Pt. 1 (with Luna Lindsey Corbden) Luna Lindsey Corbden is the author of \u0022Recovering Agency - Lifting the Veil of Mormon Mind Control.\u0022 In this multi-part Mormon Stories Podcast series, Lindsey employs the tools of social psychology to identify ways in which the Mormon church uses various coercive techniques often associated with high demand religions (also referred to as cults). Throughout the series we will be asking, \u0022In what ways does the Mormon church behave in ways similar to other high demand religions (or cults), and what can it do to become less cult-like?\u0022\n The primary goal of this series is to help people raised within the Mormon Church unpack and separate their own identity from church doctrine and policies. In their book. Luna explores 31 different mind control techniques used by high demand religions generally, and by the Mormon church specifically.\n In Part 1, we explore the basics of how cognitive dissonance works, and we will cover the first six methods (of the 31 in total): Sacred Sciene, Demand for Purity, Doctrine Over Self, Black \u0026 White Thinking, Blame Reversal, and Guilt \u0026 Shame.\n And, if you have not already, tune in to my most recent livestream (episode number 1442) for an introduction to this fascinating series!\n --------\n Luna Corbden (who also writes as Luna Lindsey) was born into the LDS Church and left the faith in 2001, at age 26.

      "description": "This week we celebrate the birthday of faithful Mormon historian and scholar Richard Bushman \u2013 author of Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling, and former Mormon church stake president and patriarch.\n Some of you will remember that I had the privilege of interviewing Richard back in 2007. Most of you probably don\u2019t know that Richard agreed to discuss 10 topics on the series, but quit the interview after only addressing 3 of the 10 topics, which was very disappointing to me at the time. But of course that was his prerogative.\n Since our original interview, Richard has declined to appear on Mormon Stories Podcast again \u2013 especially after my excommunication from the Mormon Church in 2015. Still, there are many questions that I would like to ask Richard (or any believing Mormon scholar), if he (they) would allow it. Unfortunately most faithful Mormon scholars avoid any forums where they are asked candid, difficult questions. This is not their fault, of course. It\u2019s the price of doing business with a church that silences and punishes its truth-tellers.\n Consequently, I am recording a personal episode where I go ahead and ask the questions I\u2019ve been wanting to ask Richard, along with expressing a few concerns with some of Richard\u2019s public statements over the years.\n I hope you enjoy! If you enjoy this episode, I may do something similar a few other faithful scholars/historians/apologists.",

Only recently did Kelly start to investigate the troubling issues with Mormon history that had been eating away at her children. In an effort to learn, love, and empathize with her children, she investigated the church and grew in ways that surprised her and her family.\n As Kelly chose love and understanding over dogma and compliance, she was able to open her heart to the members of her family in the LGBTQ community, including her step-daughter Kayla. Teenage years filled with the unimaginable amounts of shame and guilt, Kayla was able to grow into her own independent, confident adult, even winning Miss Salt Lake City and making her platform one of advocacy for the Utah Pride Center.\n We are honored to interview two thoughtful, articulate women putting a lot on the line to speak out while Kelly\u2019s husband still currently serves as her bishop!\n Warning: This episode contains discussions of self-harm.\n Show Notes:\n  Last Podcast on the Left Mormonism episode\u00A0 \u0022Ghost of Eternal Polygamy\u0022 by Carolyn Pearson \u00A0Gift of the Mormon Faith Crisis podcast\u00A0 Jennifer Fife Donna Showalter Mormon Stories Podcast Episode Leah and Cody Young Mormon Stories Podcast Episode \u0022Listen, Learn and Love\u0022 by Richard Ostler \u00A0Follow Kayla on Instagram",

      "description": "Despite a happy facade, Lexi struggled with anxiety and perfectionism as many young LDS people do. Subjected to the lessons specifically directed towards LDS teen girls hyper-focusing on modesty and sexual purity along with the belief that LDS men who serve missions were always trustworthy, Lexi blames herself when she is assaulted as a teen by a returned missionary. This turns into hyper-vigilance as a newlywed and mother, even going as far as to use a marker to \u201Ccensor\u201D cleavage on cartoon characters on a family board game!\n Things started to unravel for Lexi when a trusted Bishop is arrested for sexually assaulting minors in her ward and when a close friend starts questioning the Church. Hoping to help her friend and shore up her own shaken testimony, Lexi starts researching LDS Church history and truth claims with devastating results. An early conversation with her father during this time wakes Lexi up to the harm silence causes and gives her the courage to start speaking out and speaking up.\n Find Lexi on Social Media:\n  YouTube TikTok Instagram Twitter   Mormon Stories Thanks Our Generous Donors!

      "description": "Join us now for Part 3 of what many are calling a truly groundbreaking Mormon Stories Podcast series - my interview with teen convert, former All-American athlete, and former Mormon seminary teacher and CES employee Marc Oslund.\n In today\u0027s episode Marc shares with us:\n  An insider\u0027s view of how the Mormon church began realizing that it was hemorrhaging its youth and young adults, and how the church has experimented in seminary/institute/CES with both \u0022inoculation\u0022 and \u0022avoidance\u0022 when confronting its long-denied problematic history. How the Mormon church relied on Terryl Givens and other progressive Mormons to help re-train Mormon CES employees, the backlash that ensued from orthodox instructors and managers, and how the Mormon church worked hard to simultaneously distance itself from Terryl Givens\u0027 teachings. An observation that Mormon apostles no longer act as guardians of doctrine and theology, and how they have now \u0022outsourced\u0022 that work to progressive theologians like Terryl Givens and others, in part so that they can maintain plausible deniability. Marc\u0027s transition from an orthodox Mormon to a progressive/liberal (Terryl Givens)-type Mormon as a Mormon seminary teacher, in response to the training the church provided him, and how that ultimately undermined his own career in CES. How Marc was ultimately and literally pushed out of CES for explicitly following the advice of Mormon apostles like Elder Ballard to openly discuss the problematic issues. How the CES System continues to promote orthodox leaders in spite of its lip service to promoting openness and tolerance for diversity.  You will not regret the length and depth of this interview.",

Fascinating for so many reasons, I believe this is one of the most important Mormon Stories Podcast episodes I\u0027ve ever released.\n  Marc was a heavily recruited high school baseball and football player in the L.A., California area. He converted to the Mormon church as a teen. He was drafted to the baseball Major Leagues three different times, and turned down those offers to go on an LDS mission and to BYU. He was an all-American baseball player at BYU. He served an LDS mission where he was often racked with guilt and shame - almost sent home for it. When his baseball career ended (due to post-mission injuries), he became a Mormon CES seminary teacher, and served from around 2013 to 2019 - while the Mormon church was trying to become more open/honest about its history, and deal with public activists like Kate Kelly, myself, Sam Young, Jeremy Runnells, etc. Even though he constantly had doubts/questions/concerns, his position as a seminary teacher caused major rifts in his marriage when his wife expressed occasional doubts, specifically about the Mormon temple ceremony. Marc became a liberal/progressive/Givens Mormon while a seminary teacher - but was punished by CES for his progressive stances. Marc ultimately lost his orthodox Mormon faith as a seminary teacher, and was pressured to quit his job.  In part 2 of his story, we will hear about Marc\u0027s experience working for the Church Educational System as a seminary teacher, his attempts to be open with students about church doctrines, and why he eventually began to question the leadership of the LDS church - all while working within the CES program.",

      "description": "Since Title IX passed in 1972 to prevent sex discrimination under any education program receiving Federal financial assistance, the religious exemption clause has gone virtually unchaellenched. For decades, the Department of Educations has granted Title IX exemptions allowing dozens of religious colleges like BYU and Liberty University to discriminate based on sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation, even when they receive millions of taxpayer dollars every single year.\n Join us today at 4:00 pm MT as we interview attorney Paul Southwick, Chandler Horning (BYU) and Luke Wilson (Liberty University), about their groundbreaking class action lawsuit filed against the Department of Education. Chandler and Luke are among 33 former and current students from different federally-funded religious colleges who have been harmed by their discriminatory policies. The lawsuit argues that the Title IX religious exemptions \u201Cas applied to sexual and gender minority students, is unconstitutional and that the Department must enforce the protections of Title IX at all taxpayer-funded educational institutions, including at those institutions that discriminate and cause harm on the basis of sincerely held religious beliefs.\u201D",

When and how did Mark Hofmann lose his Mormon faith? What are some of the direct and undeniable similarities between Joseph Smith and Mark Hofmann? What can we ascertain about Mark Hofmann\u0027s possible motives for forgery? What issues regarding Mormon Church truth claims were being discussed publicly during Mark Hofmann\u0027s childhood and adolescence years, and what written materials may have influenced him? What behavior on the part of the Mormon church in the 1960s and 1970s may have served as motivating factors for Hofmann?\u00A0 Particularly, to what extent did the LDS Church participate in overt deception of its members that could have influenced him to turn on the church? What are Sandra\u0027s memories of Hofmann and his close associates like Shannon Flynn, Brent Metcalfe, Curt Bench, Lyn Jacobs, Brent Ashworth, etc.?\u00A0 Were any of them suspected as accomplices? What do we know about the main Mormon-related Hofmann forgeries, and why were each relevant from a Mormon.history perspective?\u00A0 How did Hofmann\u0027s forgeries intersect with and challenge Mormon church truth claims?\u00A0 How did they stand to harm the church? What role did the Mormon church play in hiding and/or covering up Hofmann\u0027s forgeries? Perhaps most importantly, Sandra recounts the inspiring story of her husband, Jerald Tanner, discovering that Hofmann\u0027s Salamander Letter was a forgery a FULL YEAR before the bombings, how she and Jerald fought about his discovery, what Hofmann\u0027s reaction was to Jerald\u0027s discovery, and how it was received in the larger Mormon studies and news community (spoiler alert: it was largely ignored). Sandra also movingly discusses how she and Jerald were largely ignored and marginalized by the broader Mormon history community, including being denied a display table at Sunstone, and how many Mormon history scholars would take advantage of the Tanner\u0027s research without giving them any credit or citations.\u00A0 She cites as the main reason of this mistreatment her and Jerald\u0027s willingness to question Joseph Smith\u0027s sincerity - which remains a taboo in the Mormon studies community to this day. Sandra recounts her memories of the bombings and of the investigations. Perhaps most importantly, what responsibility does the Mormon church play in contributing to the environment and led to the bombings?  All this, and so much more.\u00A0 This is a 6 hour interview.\n  Part 1 (4 hours) talks mostly about Sandra\u0027s memories during and after the bombings.

      "description": "\u0022View of the Hebrews\u0022 is a book first published in 1823 by Ethan Smith of Vermont.\u00A0 In \u0022View of the Hebrews,\u0022 Ethan Smith argues (among other things) that the Native Americans were descended from the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel.\u00A0 This book was so popular that it had a second printing in 1825. \u00A0\n Mormon General Authorities and apologists have feared \u0022View of the Hebrews\u0022 for over a century, starting with B.H. Roberts in the early 1900s.\n Why is \u0022View of the Hebrews\u0022\u00A0 potentially problematic for the Mormon church and the Book of Mormon?\u00A0 A few reasons:\n  Joseph Smith claimed to have come up with the idea for the Book of Mormon the VERY SAME YEAR (1823) that \u0022View of the Hebrews\u0022 was first published.\u00A0 Coincidence? Ethan Smith (the author of \u0022View of the Hebrews\u0022) was Oliver Cowdery\u0027s pastor in Vermont PRIOR to his working with Joseph Smith as Book of Mormon \u0022scribe,\u0022 and it is certain that Cowdery was familiar with the book.\u00A0 Coincidence? Mormon General Authority and historian B.H. Roberts wrote hundreds of pages doing research on the disturbing similarities between View of the Hebrews and the Book of Mormon.\u00A0 Later, B.H. Roberts went on to lose his testimony in the historicity of the Book of Mormon.\u00A0 Coincidence?  Recently, the brilliant Radio Free Mormon decided to read \u0022View of the Hebrews\u0022 from cover to cover to see what the \u0022hubub\u0022 is all about. \u00A0\n Join us as we explore the following questions:\n  What is View of the Hebrews fundamentally about? What are the important similarities and differences between View of the Hebrews and the Book of Mormon? Was Ethan Smith\u0027s \u0022View of the Hebrews\u0022 a source of inspiration for the Book of Mormon? What cultural dynamics were at play in upstate New York in the early 1820s that could have influenced BOTH books? Are there any direct connections between \u0022View of the Hebrews\u0022 and Joseph Smith? Why has \u0022View of the Hebrews\u0022 caused so much concern for Mormon apologists, from B.H. Roberts to today ? How have Mormon apologists responded to View of the Hebrews? Does \u0022View of the Hebrews\u0022 present significant, compelling problems for LDS Church and Book of Mormon truth claims?",

      "description": "Chelsea and Nick Homer were both raised as devout Utah Mormons - with all the good and bad this entailed, and both were equally determined to have the perfect Mormon marriage and family.\u00A0\u00A0After meeting at BYU and an extended, careful courtship, Chelsea and Nick were married in the Bountiful temple. Then their Mormon dream immediately began to fray.\n Beginning with the wedding night/honeymoon, Chelsea and Nick experienced problems with sexual intimacy, due (in large part) to unhealthy messages they received around sexual \u0022purity\u0022 and \u0022modesty\u0022 as Mormon teens.\u00A0\u00A0Then, a year into their marriage, Nick began to lose his testimony in the Mormon church - causing Nick and Chelsea to seriously contemplate divorce.\n When it became clear that Nick was not going to perform the priesthood blessing for their their firstborn child, Chelsea and Nick decided to courageously post about their situation on her Instagram account, in part to defy the shaming and unhealthy rumors that so often accompany this situation within Mormonism (e.g., \u0022Nick must be into PORN!\u0022). This post was dated September 24, 2017.\n Surprisingly to both Chelsea and Nick, a Public Relations employee for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints asked if Chelsea would write a post about this experience for the Church\u2019s Instagram.\u00A0This post (dated February 7, 2018) can be found here, and to date has 58,947 \u0022likes.\u0022\u00A0 Later, the LDS Church PR department asked Chelsea to author an article about navigating her Mormon mixed-faith marriage as a believing wife.\u00A0 This heavily correlated article is entitled \u0022Who Do I Choose - God or My Husband? - and was published by lds.org on July 25, 2018.\n After these social media posts, Chelsea and Nick immediately began receiving messages, emails, and phone calls from other young Mormon couples also experiencing faith crises and/or mixed-faith marriages.\u00A0\u00A0To help provide support and community for all the young Mormon women who were struggling with faith crises, Chelsea formed on July 31, 2019 a Facebook group entitled \u0022Faith Journey Meetups,\u0022 which at present has over 2,000 members.\u00A0\u00A0The description of this group is as follows:\n  Welcome! This is a meetup hub for women who are actively navigating their personal faith journeys anywhere along the LDS belief spectrum. Come, make friends, schedule get-togethers. This is a safe place to find support and turn internet acquaintances into real life friends.\n  Eventually, Chelsea also lost her faith in the Mormon church, and today Nick and Chelsea are navigating a life of healing, growth, and joy after Mormonism.\n This is their story.",

Please share it with all your believing Mormon family members and friends.\u00A0 If they are concerned about the content, consider letting them know that:  Richard Turley (former assistant LDS Church historian and head of LDS Church Public Affairs) participates in the documentary, and The documentary was carefully designed by both Jared and Tyler to be fair/balanced.\u00A0 In my opinion, the doc is TOTALLY TBM worthy, so please watch it AND tell everyone about it!    I am planning several super cool interviews, including an interview with Directors - Jared Hess and Tyler Measom.\u00A0 So stay tuned for that! Here\u0027s where I need your help.\u00A0 I would REALLY love it if you would share with me: a) your reactions to the doc, and b) any questions you have for Jared and Tyler.

      "description": "Hey Mormon Stories Listeners - I need your help!!!! This Friday (9am mountain time) I will be interviewing Mike Rinder - a former high-level leader of the Church of Scientology. I only have an hour with Mike, so I want to spend at least a few minutes of the hour comparing the Mormon church with the Church of Scientology. To be clear - I have studied Scientology enough to know that it is deeply problematic....from literally kidnapping/imprisoning members, to having members physically beaten, to militantly suing members, etc. In short, I know that Scientology is a brutal, inhumane, super-harmful cult. Consequently, I am also fully aware that any comparison between the Mormon church and the Church of Scientology is deeply fraught. But hear me out. I once read in Jared Diamond\u0027s \u0022Guns, Germs, and Steel\u0022 that sometimes the less immediately lethal viruses are often the most harmful viruses overall, primarily BECAUSE they are less deadly than their counterparts. In other words, if a virus is so deadly that it immediately kills its hosts, it has a tougher time spreading, and ultimately harms fewer organisms. Conversely, if a virus doesn\u0027t kill its host, but makes its hosts sick enough for a long enough time, the virus can spread much more successfully to a much larger population, and do more harm overall to many more people . Get it? And so this is where I would like your feedback...and it\u0027s only an intellectual exercise. Here is the question: If the variables we are measuring include: 1) Total human hours extracted from members without fully informed consent (total hours wasted under false pretenses, in a sense), 2) Total abuse/pain/suffering inflicted on humans under false pretenses, and 3) Total $$$ amount fraudulently extracted from its members over the lifetime of the church....again, under false pretenses and without informed consent.... ...could an argument be made that the Mormon church, in aggregate, causes more overall harm than the Church of Scientology...in part BECAUSE it is somewhat less severe overall? Also, what arguments/points am I missing? Please make your best case below (one way or the other), and I will do my best to incorporate your input into my discussion with Mike Rinder on Friday. Also, if you have any questions for Mike, please share them below and I will try my best to incorporate them. THANKS IN ADVANCE! John Dehlin P.S. Please know that I KNOW that the Mormon Church does a TON of good in the world (particularly for its members). Believe me....I see that, and I believe that. I am talking about the harm that the Mormon Church causes IN SPITE of all the good it does as well.",

      "description": "Please join me as I interview Dr. William L. Davis about his book \u0022Visions in a Seer Stone: Joseph Smith and the Making of the Book of Mormon.\u0022\n In this interdisciplinary work, William L. Davis examines Joseph Smith\u0027s 1829 creation of the Book of Mormon, the foundational text of the Latter Day Saint movement. Positioning the text within the history of early American oratorical techniques, sermon culture, educational practices, and the passion for self-improvement, Davis elucidates both the fascinating cultural contexts for the creation of the Book of Mormon and the central role of oral culture in early nineteenth-century America.\n Drawing on performance studies, religious studies, literary culture, and the history of early American education, Davis analyzes Smith\u2019s process of oral composition. How did he produce a history spanning a period of 1,000 years, filled with hundreds of distinct characters and episodes, all cohesively tied together in an overarching narrative? Eyewitnesses claimed that Smith never looked at notes, manuscripts, or books\u2014he simply spoke the words of this American religious epic into existence. Judging the truth of this process is not Davis\u0027s interest. Rather, he reveals a kaleidoscope of practices and styles that converged around Smith\u0027s creation, with an emphasis on the evangelical preaching styles popularized by the renowned George Whitefield and John Wesley.\n William L. Davis, an independent scholar, holds a Ph.D. in theater and performance and has published in Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought; John Bunyan Studies: A Journal of Reformation and Nonconformist Culture; Leviathan: A Journal of Melville Studies; Style; Text and Performance Quarterly; and Textual Cultures.\n Dr. William L. Davis\u2019 book, \u201CVisions in a Seer Stone: Joseph Smith and the Making of the Book of Mormon\u201D can be purchased in the following ways:\n University of North Carolina Press\n Amazon",

      "description": "Please join me as Neon Trees front man Tyler Glenn and award-winning pianist and composer Paul Cardall return to Mormon Stories Podcast to premiere a new music video: \u0022I Know It Hurts\u0022, from Paul Cardall\u0027s memoir-style album \u0022The Broken Miracle.\u0022 We would welcome your questions for Tyler and Paul during this live Q\u0026A.\n \n   \u00A0\n \n   \u201CI Know It Hurts\u201D was co-written by Cardall and Glenn after they met several years ago at the famed LOVELOUD Festival, where they were both performing. Glenn is co-founder of the festival, alongside Imagine Dragon\u2019s Dan Reynolds.\n \n   \u00A0\n \n   \u201CBefore writing this song, Tyler and I discussed at length the challenges we all feel that result from trauma,\u201D Cardall explains. \u201CIn my case, though my heart transplant was a beautifully orchestrated miracle, it was still the grand finale to a lot of years of medical trauma. It triggered anxiety and depression. For everyone who is suffering, not necessarily physically, but because they are different or feel like an outsider, I want to say to them, \u2018I know it hurts.\u2019 This song acknowledges that you are not alone. This song validates our feelings in a way that says, \u2018keep going, keep fighting, we understand.\u2019\u201D\n \n   \u00A0\n \n   Glenn adds,\n \n   \u00A0\n \n   \u201CI wanted the lyric and performance of this song to convey a sense of understanding how it feels to get through a trauma or heartache. So much of life for many is the search for a sense of belonging, a sense of self-worth. This song feels more like an acknowledgement of that, and I hope it brings a feeling of being seen and comforted. I hope those in pain from whatever it may be, feel a sense of validation.\u201D\n \n   \u00A0\n \n   The video, directed by Rob Norbutt, is in stark black and white, the simplicity of which amplifies the power of the message:\n \n   \u00A0\n \n   You\u2019ve been floating out in space\n \n   You just wanted to believe\n \n   There were tears upon your face\n \n   And your body felt no ease\n \n   Dear God is there not more\n \n   Cuz it\u2019s cold on the church floor\n \n   \u00A0\n \n   Cardall\u2019s new album is more than a colorful collection of 19 emotionally-charged songs. The Broken Miracle is a musical memoir, a personal manifesto that celebrates a life filled with nearly unfathomable tragedy and heady triumph. An enthusiastic collaborator, Cardall welcomes an all-star cast of creative partners on The Broken Miracle. The title track was penned with Christian music veteran Matt Hammitt and Carter Forge, and is sung by Hammitt. \u201CBroken Machine\u201D features singer/songwriter Rachael Yamagata\u2019s vocals on the tune Cardall co-wrote with Yamagata and Trevor Price. In addition to Glenn, the project also includes appearances by Ty Herndon, J.

      "description": "After being raised by an orthodox Mormon mother and a \u0022redneck, somewhat Jack Mormon Pioneer stock dad,\u0022 Gretchen Day decided that she was going to be an \u0022all in\u0022 Mormon mother.\u00A0 After getting engaged at age 19 (as a BYU Freshman), Gretchen went on to get married in the LDS temple, and to fulfill many of the stereotypes of a Utah County Ultra-Orthodox Mormon mother, including:\n  Having 8 children. Homeschooling her children using Book of Mormon-based curriculum. Raising her children with little to no media. Imposing strict \u0022modesty\u0022 guidelines on her children (mostly her daughters). Doing at least one underwater home birth. Pursuing strict dietary practices (\u0022perfect eating) such as restricting sugar, eating only raw, vegan foods, etc.  Over time, Gretchen\u0027s ultra-orthodox Mormon dream began to crumble in several different ways:\n  She began to experience serious depression. She started making serious life decisions based on \u0022spiritual experiences\u0022 based on feelings -- that may not have been very healthy for her (in hindsight). Some of her children started to lose their testimonies of the church. She had a son who became seriously depressed and ultimately suicidal, based in part on inhumane \u0022worthiness\u0022 interviews conducted by well-intentioned bishops, mission, and stake presidents - who were/are operating within an abusive system.\u00A0 This included feeling pressure to lie about his faith crisis to his home ward and BYU bishop, in order to keep his place at BYU and to stay in good standing with the church. She began learning about factual Mormon church history (e.g., polygamy, Book of Mormon problems), which became deeply triggering for her.  As Gretchen\u0027s faith began to crumble, she started to feel trapped within the Utah County Mormon bubble.\n  Should she lie to her son about her faith journey, as he was preparing to leave on his mission, or should she be honest with him and risk spoiling his experience? Was she trapped in a \u0022Mormon mafia\u0022 of sorts, with no escape? Should she \u0022come out\u0022 to fellow ward members and leadership, and risk social ostracization? Or should she quietly \u0022fade away\u0022 from church activity to avoid any conflict?  In Gretchen\u0027s case, she decided to leave the church in a very vocal fashion.\u00A0 This has included:\n  Writing a letter/email ward members to explain why she was leaving the church. Inviting her bishopric to attend a \u0022Resignation Speech\u0022 that she offered to them, primarily with the intent of recovering her lost voice as a Mormon woman, and speaking her truth. Diving deeply into the \u0022cult\u0022 and \u0022unethical persuasion\u0022 literature, Creating a web site to share her story and perspectives with the world. Authoring a series of children\u0027s books to help parents educate their children about how to avoid falling prey to undue influence of any sort.  If you are seeking a powerful, inspiring story of one ultra-orthodox Utah county Mother\u0027s journey out of Mormonism, this is it.\u00A0 If you enjoyed the interviews of folks like Donna Showalter, Leah Young, you will deeply treasure this interview (but only after it breaks your heart).",

      "description": "Join me today for one of my favorite Mormon Stories Podcast interviews/interviewees of all time. In today\u0027s episode, Stanford University graduate student Amy McPhie Allebest returns to discuss the development of patriarchy within human civilization, with a specific focus on the religious context. She also announces her new podcast entitled \u0022Breaking Down Patriarchy - An Essential Texts Book Club.\u0022\n Patriarchy has incredibly deep roots in the human condition, and harms everyone - especially women, but also men, youth, and children. This episode is for ALL of us, and you will not be disappointed with Amy\u0027s incredible knowledge, insight, and compassion.\n The Oxford Dictionary defines patriarchy as \u0022a system of society or government in which men hold the power and women are largely excluded from it.\u0022 All cultures all over the world practice patriarchy, sometimes violently, sometimes seemingly benevolently, sometimes in ways we are so accustomed to that we don\u0027t even notice. But when was patriarchy instituted? How? Why? Who has challenged this system, and how have their critiques changed the world?\n Breaking Down Patriarchy: An Essential Texts Book Club answers these questions, as well as addressing the very personal ways that patriarchy impacts our lives and relationships. Every week, an intelligent, insightful, relatable guest joins host Amy McPhie Allebest to read and discuss a historical text. Listeners are invited to read the book ahead of time, but even if they are not able to read, Amy and her reading partners provide a thorough \u0022breakdown\u0022 of the issues and powerful, practical takeaways that benefit the real lives of women - and men! - everywhere.\n Check out the introductory episode to hear about the reading list, and the egalitarian vision that aims to foster the flourishing of all human beings, including boys and men.\n Amy\u0027s Bio: I grew up in Colorado as the oldest of 5 children, reading, writing, drawing, singing, and practicing the piano and violin. I attended Brigham Young University, where I met Erik Allebest during my first week of freshman year, studied abroad in Israel, lived in Chile for a year and a half as a missionary, and married Erik all before graduating with a degree in English. Erik and I moved around - to Colorado, Southern California, Utah, Spain, and Northern California - while Erik started and ran chess businesses for a living (primarily chess.com) and I stayed home to raise our four children. Those four kids have become brilliant, hilarious people and are our very best friends. I am a long-time trail runner, a recent CrossFitter, a lifelong reader and writer, and an almost-graduate of Stanford University\u0027s Master\u0027s of Liberal Arts program.\n Web Site Link: www.breakingdownpatriarchy.com\n Facebook Page: facebook.com/breakingdownpatriarchy\n Instagram: @bdownpatriarchy\n Twitter: @bdownpatriarchy #patriarchy #feminism #mormon",

      "description": "In my opinion, one of the most damaging books ever published by the Mormon Church is Spencer W. Kimball\u2019s \u201CThe Miracle of Forgiveness.\u201D Among other things, this book teaches that:\n  No young Mormon man or woman is worthy to go on a mission if they masturbate. Masturbation alone leads to masturbation with others, which leads to \u201Chomosexuality.\u201D Being gay or lesbian is \u201Cugly,\u201D \u201Crepugnant,\u201D and comparable to a disease. \u201CHomosexuality\u201D leads to bestiality. \u201CHomosexuality\u201D can be easily \u201Ccured.\u201D People who have pre-marital sex, and even rape victims, are \u201Cblighted\u201D and \u201Cscarred.\u201D It is far better to die than to lose one\u2019s \u201Cvirtue.\u201D Death by suicide is a sign of foolishness, faithlessness and/or weakness and/or sin.  To be clear, this book is currently sold at Deseret Book, and remains on the book shelves of hundreds of thousands of Mormons across the world.\n In this short presentation, I offer my brief argument for why I believe that \u201CThe Miracle of Forgiveness\u201D should be removed from Deseret Book, and I let listeners and viewers know what they can do to help. I also share my thoughts on what the Mormon Church can do to help \u201Catone\u201D for selling this damaging book for several decades.\n How You Can Help:\n  Share this Presentation. Email Deseret Book:  service@deseretbook.com mediainquiry@deseretbook.com hrdept@deseretbook.com   Call Deseret Book  1-800-453-4532 (Toll-Free US and Canada) 1-801-517-3369 (International)   Speak to any influencers you know. Do what you can to remove this book from the access of people who might be vulnerable (book shelves, etc.). Please share with me/us what you did, and the reactions. Remember the date: 1/18/2021. Monitor deseretbook.com for when they take the book down. I will throw a party when it\u2019s gone (likely this summer post-COVID)  P.S. This is a re-recording to make the video less \u201Cranty,\u201D and to remove the discussion of book bans and book burnings, which is not useful. HUGE thanks to everyone who gave feedback on this. I always want to be a constructive voice.",

      "description": "In a recent video released by paid actors supported by FAIRMormon and the More Good Foundation, Kwaku El, Brad Witbeck, and Cardon Ellis make the claim that I and Mormon Stories (and Jeremy Runnells) are intentionally \u0022homewrecking for profit\u0022 with the work we do.\n In an attempt to combat this hurtful claim, I reached out to our amazing Mormon Stories Listeners, requesting your help by sharing if/how Mormon Stories Podcast has helped your family. I have been deeply honored and humbled by the overwhelming support we have received, and would like to personally thank each one of you that were brave enough to share your own \u201CMormon Story\u201D with me.\n Mormon Stories podcast seeks to understand, explore, challenge, and improve the Mormon experience through stories, and has never had the intention of harming families in any way. In fact, we strive to support and mend family relationships by promoting healthy communication skills and unconditional love.\n The primary objectives of Mormon Stories podcast include:\n  Providing support to Mormons who are transitioning away from either orthodox Mormonism, or from Mormonism altogether, with a particular emphasis on:   Minimizing the anxiety, depression, and occasional suicidality that can accompany a transition away from religious orthodoxy. Reducing the number of unnecessary divorces attributable to Mormon faith crises. Creating a community of support for liberal/progressive and post-Mormons.   Building greater awareness regarding accurate LDS/Mormon church history, doctrine, and theology \u2013 so that both active, believing Mormons and investigators of the church can make informed decisions regarding their investment in, and engagement with the church. Identifying opportunities for growth/improvement within the LDS church, and within broader Mormon culture.  Mormon Stories Podcast by no means benefits from the destruction of families, and we are saddened to see our community mis-represented in this way. It is my hope that the personal accounts represented in this video will be evidence of how Mormon Stories has actually benefited the lives of our listeners, and lay to rest the claim that Jeremy Runnells and myself have ever participated in \u201Chomewrecking for profit.\u201D\n Thank you.",

      "description": "Recently, the Mormon apologetic organization FAIRMormon has released several aggressive new videos via their YouTube Channel starring the actors Kwaku El, Cardon Ellis, and Brad Witbeck. These videos are intended to appeal to younger Latter-day saints, but also launch aggressive attacks against me (John Dehlin) and Jeremy Runnells (author of the CES Letter). The historical accuracy/honesty of these videos has also been called into question by many.\n Today we interview Anthony D. Miller - a wise and thoughtful post-Mormon - about these latest events. Some of the topics we hope to cover are listed below. We would also welcome your questions/comments.\n Topics for today:\n  Motivations behind Mormon apologetics. Differences between Mormon apologetics and critical scholarship Contrast traditional apologetics and more progressive, nuanced apologetics Examples of people who have shifted from apologetics towards critical scholarship, and their explanations as to \u201Cthe why.\u201D Examples of people who engage with critical scholarship, but operate within Mormonism with a mostly a metaphorical paradigm with an apologetic bent. Contrast how GenZ, Millennials, GenX, and Baby Boomers engage with information. How GenZ at times experiences fragility, catastrophizing, call-out culture, and perception of violence in speech, and how these things affect engagement with apologetics and scholarship. (Jonathan Haidt\u2019s book, The Coddling of the American Mind). Current spectrum of apologetics Approaches and methods for distribution  Firesides and conferences Radical Orthodoxy proclamation, Deznat, etc. Adaptations to respond to social media, YouTube, TikTok   What we might expect going forward Will this approach work? Will it backfire? Is it ethical?",

Feel free to include what role (if any) the LDS Church, and/or apologetic sites like FAIRMormon played in promoting family health and unity, or in harming your family. Please email your videos to me here: mormonstories@gmail.com, or you can message them to me on Facebook. Or if you prefer to write your story, please do so in the comments below. Please know that these videos and/or this text could be used publicly.

      "description": "Paul Cardall battled long odds from birth, eventually triumphing over a serious heart disability to earn distinction as an outstanding composer and pianist. In 1997 he first won widespread notice by setting author Richard Paul Evans\u2019 No. 1 NY Times best-seller The Christmas Box to music. Cardall\u2019s achievements range from releasing 11 chart-topping albums, winning the Gospel Music Association Dove Award for Instrumental Album of the Year, collaborating with Grammy-winning singer CeCe Winans, Audrey Assad, The Piano Guys among other distinguished artists.\n With over 2 billion streams, Cardall is one of the most listened to Steinway \u0026 Sons sponsored artist in music business. His entrepreneurial activities include founding and directing the Stone Angel Music label and recording studio, promoting medical research and providing scholarships for congenital heart disease through his foundation. Cardall\u2019s music has included works for piano, vocal, band and orchestral settings. On his latest album, Peaceful Piano, he returns to his solo performance roots while exploring complete real-time improvisation for the first time.\n Paul\u0027s Mormon story includes:\n  Growing up in Salt Lake City, Utah, learning to \u0022fit in\u0022 as a child and youth with a heart condition. Serving an LDS mission, and marrying in an LDS temple. Paul\u0027s rise to celebrity as a piano performer - first in Salt Lake City, then joining the LDS Church speaking/inspiration circuit, and ultimately becoming a world-renowned musician, with hundreds of millions of Spotify downloads. Paul\u0027s receipt of a human heart transplant, and his recovery. Paul\u0027s struggles to maintain a healthy/happy marriage, ultimately leading to his disfellowshipment from the LDS Church and a shaming public divorce. Paul\u0027s remarriage to a non-LDS woman, and his invitation to co-author a Mormon hymn with LDS Church apostle David A. Bednar called \u0022One by One.\u0022 Paul\u0027s loss of testimony in the LDS Church, and his discovery of a new faith in traditional, non-denominational Christianity.  Cardall\u2019s story is continuing to evolve as an artist, author and humanitarian. His upcoming album The Broken Miracle, which will be available for pre-order this December, was inspired by J.D. Netto\u2019s biographical fictional novel, based on real events in the artists life from being born with only half a heart, enduring a series of surgeries, which culminated in a heart transplant. While waiting for a donor heart, the pianist\u2019s brother was tragically killed. The album will feature several award-winning guests including David Archuleta, Ty Herndon, Thompson Square, Neon Tress\u2019 Tyler Glenn and more.\n We hope you enjoy this episode!\u00A0 Paul is a fantastic human.",

      "description": "In today\u0027s Mormon Stories Podcast episode legendary Utah journalist and investigator Lynn Packer discusses his recent investigation into possible fraud perpetrated by Utah Mormon Tim Ballard and Utah Mormon Attorney General Sean Reyes - as part of Operation Underground Railroad (OUR), which has raised over $30 million claiming to rescue children from sex trafficking.\n Packer has raised concerns about Tim Ballard and Sean Reyes being involved in the following:\n - Stockpiling $30M in donations that are not being used to save children.\n - Excessive compensation to Tim Ballard (over $300k/year). - Unethical accounting that now is likely hiding Tim Ballard\u0027s total compensation.\n - Lavish expenditures (e.g., first class flights, 5 star hotels, dramatic helicopter appearances) with no financial accountability about how funds are used.\n - Using false statistics to over-state the prevalence of child sex trafficking worldwide to lure donors.\n - Using excessive emotion and religious manipulation to lure donors, including claims to be called of God, and to be protected by God in OUR\u0027s work.\n - Using affinity with Mormon celebrities like Mormon apostle M. Russell Ballard, Glenn Beck, and Elizabeth/Ed Smart to lure donors.\n - Claiming credit for raids that they were not involved with. - Engaging in illegal and unsafe raids (jump teams) that often yield no positive results.\n - Alleged unsavory behavior of jump team members, including illegal drug use during raids, sexual assault, etc.\n - Drawing money and attention away from legitimate charities who are meaningfully providing solutions to the problems OUR decries.\n - Victimizing and politicizing the suffering of children for political gain (Sean Reyes).\n - Associating with and taking advantage of known false conspiracy theories like QAnon.\n - Using the LDS Church\u0027s law firm (Kirton \u0026 McConkie) to intimidate and silence whistleblowers.\n - In summary, manipulating wealthy donors through religious and patriotic emotion and misusing or misallocating funds, all on the backs of a very vulnerable population.\n Lynn Packer is best know for accurately exposing Mormon General Authority Paul H. Dunn for lying to Mormon church members about made-up World War II heroics and about playing professional baseball, all of which led to Elder Dunn being prematurely fired as a General Authority (and which the Mormon church tried to cover up through intimidation).\n Please join us if you have comments or questions for Lynn.\n NOTE: This podcast is not asserting that any of these allegations are true. Only that Lynn is claiming to have gathered evidence in support of these positions.",

      "description": "Paul H. Dunn is one of the most beloved General Authorities in the history of the Mormon church. His vast popularity was based on his uncanny ability to tell gripping stories in General Conference, in firesides, in over a dozen books, and on cassette tapes about his time as a professional baseball player with the St. Louis Cardinals, and about his career as a combat veteran in World War II.\n The only problems were:\n 1) Paul Dunn made up these stories. They were literally untrue.\n 2) Paul Dunn made a great deal of money, and drew his fame from these false stories.\n 3) Paul Dunn used his fame/reputation to advance fraudulent business schemes.\n Even more disturbing, however, were the lengths and breadths that the Mormon church went to, to suppress, cover-up, and kill this story - using its vast financial and legal resources.\n This story only came to light because of one courageous Mormon journalist - Lynn Kenneth Packer - who coincidentally was the nephew of super powerful/influential Mormon apostle Boyd K. Packer.\n In the end, Lynn Packer was fired from his job as a BYU professor for his involvement in investigating and breaking the Paul H. Dunn story. And while this story was minimally covered in an Arizona newspaper and in Sunstone magazine at the time, TO THIS DAY Lynn Packer has never been granted an extensive media interview to tell this story.\n Until today that is.",

Roberts and others), and towards the prioritization of emotion-based orthodoxy and fundamentalism (based on the influence of J. Rueben Clark, Harold B. Lee, Joseph Fielding Smith, etc.) The careers of both LDS apostle Boyd K. Packer and GA Paul H. Dunn,\u00A0 And, The eventual backlash against science and scholarship led by Boyd K. Packer from the 1980s through today, which led to the intentional hiding of factual LDS Church history, and the punishment of scholars and thinkers (from the September 6 to modern excommunicants like myself).  This 30 minute video will provide important background for the subsequent 3 episodes with Lynn.",

Phillips penned a courageous, thoughtful response to this letter, which can be accessed here.\n Today we interview the two founders of the \u0022Project Rainbow\u0022 initiative in the Autumn Ridge section of Sandy, Utah: Kristy and Willy Donahoo.\u00A0\u00A0We also interview Cynthia Phillips, who is an active, believing member of her local LDS ward, and who fervently supports this initiative.\n Our goals with this episode are:\n  To spotlight good people doing good things.

      "description": "Katie Harmon was raised Catholic in Laramie, Wyoming. After falling in love with a Mormon boy at age 15, Katie became socially/emotionally converted to the LDS Church in spite of...\n  High ambitions for herself (Katie was a 4.0 student, got a 33 on her ACT, was in AP classes, got a full ride scholarship to the University of Wyoming, and wanted to become a doctor) and Strongly valuing social justice (e.g., anti-homophobia, anti-sexism, anti-racism).  As Katie became fully committed to the Mormon church, she saw her original aspirations slowly slip away, as she began to follow \u0022the Mormon way for women.\u0022 Katie ended up:\n  Experiencing severe Scrupulosity as a Mormon woman. Enduring an invasive and inappropriate \u0022sexual repentance\u0022 process. Marrying 3 months after graduating high school to a man she had only known 7 months. Getting sealed to her husband while her non-LDS family sat outside the Mormon temple. Having three children within a short period of time before she felt ready to do so, based on LDS teachings. Feeling frustrated when, after her 2nd child was diagnosed with major health issues at 20 weeks, priesthood blessings failed to heal her ailing child. She basically discovered after conversion that the \u0022Priesthood power\u0022 was not real, and did not work. Confronting the stifling \u0022ableism\u0022 of Mormon doctrine, theology, and culture.  As Katie\u0027s hopes and dreams began to fall apart, she began studying Mormonism more closely, and discovered that she was not taught as an investigator important truths about Mormon history and the LDS church that would likely have prevented her from joining.\n Katie\u0027s motivation for doing this interview is to call on the LDS Church to be fully honest in its missionary efforts, and in its education of children and youth, so that people like her can not be misled into joining and/or committing their lives to the Mormon church without being fully informed about its history, doctrine, and theology.",

Is it possible to reconcile religious belief with a natural, scientific view of the universe?\n Many people see secular and religious views as incompatible. They seem to believe it necessary to suspend disbelief and accept superstition in order to be religious, or that religion is an obstacle to productive engagement with the world. Even many of us who still profess some level of religiosity will admit that religion sometimes makes productive engagement more difficult and is sometimes less effective than it could be. For those who believe in prophecies of the eventual redemption of humanity, is it possible to work toward a vision of the future that is understood only vaguely, if at all? What is the effect of faith that is not active? Might active faith in Mormon (and other religious) visions of the future be essential to realizing them?\n Today we\u0027ll be talking with Carl Youngblood about his life as a Mormon and a transhumanist, what that word even means, and how his struggle to apply his faith meaningfully in our rapidly changing world has led him to co-found the Mormon Transhumanist Association, where he currently serves as a member of the board of Directors. Carl looks forward to sharing his ideas and answering your questions about his life and faith.",

      "description": "As many of you will recall, Shannon Caldwell Montez joined us on Mormon Stories Podcast in July, 2020 to tell us her own story, as well as to tell us the story of B.H. Roberts - the LDS Church historian  and General Authority who was tasked to answer problems about Book of Mormon historicity, only to lose his testimony of the Book of Mormon as a historical document.\n During the B.H. Roberts episode we learned about a series of all-day meetings B.H. Roberts had in January, 1922 with the LDS Church First Presidency, Quorum of 12 Apostles, and the Quorum of 70 to discuss these Book of Mormon problems in-depth. Ultimately, Shannon shows in her thesis that the LDS church leadership was both unprepared and unwilling to address the problems Roberts presented - resulting in much disappointment and frustration for Roberts.\n In this follow-up interview with Shannon, we review evidence addressing the question as to whether or not Mormon General Authority and church historian B.H. Roberts lost his testimony of the Book of Mormon as a historical document.\n Resources Mentioned in the Podcast Include:\n  Shannon\u0027s Thesis: The Secret Mormon Meetings of 1922 B.H.

Wayment -- as together they discovered literally hundreds of instances where Joseph Smith plagiarized portions of the Joseph Smith \u0022Translation\u0022 of the Bible directly from Adam Clarke\u0027s Bible Commentary.\n Today\u0027s story includes:\n  Haley\u0027s early years growing up as a highly devout Mormon girl and young woman who struggled significantly with undiagnosed religious anxiety (possibly scrupulosity). Haley\u0027s LDS mission to Panama. Haley\u0027s discovery of Joseph Smith\u0027s plagiarism, as she was working as a BYU undergraduate research assistant under Dr. Thomas A. Wayment. Haley\u0027s deep struggle with her Mormon faith once she began studying the authenticity of Mormon scripture and other truth claims. Haley\u0027s troubling brush with the BYU Honor Code Office, which almost resulted in her being expelled from BYU. How Haley\u0027s name was almost removed from the publishing of her research with Dr. Wayment. A review of Haley\u0027s current views on LDS Church truth claims.  As a part of this interview, we will be discussing in-depth the article/chapter \u0022A Recently Recovered Source: The Use of Adam Clarke\u2019s Bible Commentary in Joseph Smith\u2019s Bible Translation\u0022 that she co-authored with Thomas A. Wayment, which recently appeared in the newly released book \u0022Producing Ancient Scripture: Joseph Smith\u0027s Translation Projects in the Development of Mormon Christianity,\u0022 edited by Michael MacKay, Mark Ashurst-McGee, and Brian M.

Their son, Sam Jr., was suffering with Scrupulosity (religious OCD) And both Sam and Sara were beginning to question their Mormon faith while Sam was serving as bishop.  Today\u2019s episode tells the story of how a devout Mormon family in Ammon, Idaho, led by a Mormon Bishop, can end up losing their faith in Mormonism in 2020.\u00A0 It also includes a full recounting of how Sam began to speak openly about his struggles with the church after losing his faith - leading to threats and ultimately a disciplinary council/excommunication.\u00A0 And yes, Sam recorded and is now sharing here the full audio of his excommunication (Part 6).\n\nSam\u2019s wife Sara, along with two of their brilliant children - Olivia and Sam Jr. - also participate in this super-thoughtful story/discussion.\n You will not be disappointed in this episode.\u00A0 HUGE thanks to Sam Sr., Sara, Olivia, and Sam Jr. for their willingness to join us on Mormon Stories Podcast and tell their epic story.",

      "description": "Today on Mormon Stories Podcast we continue our series on the history of Repressed Memory Therapy and claims of Satanic Ritual Abuse within Utah Mormonism.\u00A0\u00A0\n \u00A0\n Today\u2019s interview is with \u201CKim,\u201D who tells her experiences of being subjected to techniques of hypnosis and repressed/recovered memory in Provo/Orem Utah between 1988 and 1992.\u00A0 In the interview Kim discusses her traumatic childhood - which led to her conversion to Mormonism, and left her vulnerable to Repressed/Recovered Memory techniques in adulthood while she was attempting to recover from childhood PTSD.\n \u00A0\n While living in Provo/Orem, UT and struggling in her early marriage, Kim was referred to Mormon therapists  Rex Kocherhans and Ruth Kilpack - both of whom were practitioners of Repressed/Recovered Memory therapy.\u00A0 Interestingly, Ruth Killpack was referred to Kim by her LDS bishop, and was also a therapist to Martha Beck, who  controversially claimed that her late father, Mormon scholar and apologist Hugh Nibley, sexually abused her.\u00A0 Martha Beck has acknowledged that her memories of abuse were recovered through these same Repressed/Recovered Memory techniques.\u00A0\n \u00A0\n As Ruth engaged in therapy with Mormon therapists Rex Kocherhans and Ruth Kilpack, Ruth was pressured in therapy using hypnosis to \u201Cremember\u201D being sexually abused during her childhood, which resulted in her accusing several family members of sexual abuse - even though she was never convinced that the \u201Cmemories\u201D produced under hypnosis were real.\u00A0 As these accusations left Kim increasingly paranoid, ostracized from her family, and ultimately re-traumatized - and as Kim grew increasingly uncomfortable with her therapists\u2019 lack of appropriate boundaries and unethical therapeutic ethics -- Kim determined that her \u201Cmemories\u201D of family abuse were in fact implanted or manipulated by her therapists.\u00A0 \n\n\u201CKim\u201D was later directly interviewed by Mormon General Authority Glenn Pace as a part of his  investigation into Satanic Ritual within Mormonism, and eventually Kim spoke out as an advocate against \u201C\u201DRepressed or Recovered Memory\u201D Techniques in newspapers, and on TV.\n \u00A0\n This is Kim\u2019s story.",

      "description": "Given the high demand for coaching support right now and the cash crunch being felt by everyone, I am putting together two weekly online Mormon faith transition support groups: one for individuals, and one for couples. I am limiting the individual group to 8 people, and the couples group to 4 couples. There are three main benefits to support groups: 1) They are more effective, mostly because you get input/support/ideas/motivation from an entire group. 2) They last longer (1.5 hours/week instead of 1 hour/week). 3) They are cheaper.  Topics for these groups will include: - Navigating a faith crisis. - Navigating relationships with believing family and friends. - Improving mental health. - Improving marriage/relationships. - Parenting. - Building a new, healthy life after a faith crisis. - Whatever else folks want/need. I have a Ph.D. in clinical and counseling psychology with 6 years of training in group therapy - and will be moderating these support groups. Margi may join us from time to time, depending on topic. You will sign up for an automatic, weekly payment. The cost is $40/week/individual, and $80/week/couple. We will establish a regular meeting day/time once the group is filled. We will meet online, viz Zoom. This is the registration page for the individual group. https://donorbox.org/mormonfaithtransitiongroup If you know anyone who might benefit from this group, please spread the word. Email for any questions at: drjohndehlin@gmail.com",

Not flawless\u2026.not perfect\u2026..just thriving. When I say thriving, I mean overall healthier and happier than when you were active in the church.\n HOW: I have put together 20 questions for THRIVING post-Mormons and progressive Mormons to reflect upon, and to answer. I have had numerous people tell me that the simple process of reflecting upon and answering these questions has been deeply therapeutic for them. Some have even wept joyful or grief-filled tears as they\u2019ve gone through the process of answering the questions.\n I hope to release at least a few profiles a week over the next 6-12 months.\n Candidates for future Mormon Stories Podcast episodes will be culled from these profiles.\n I hope to include these profiles in an upcoming book that I hope to write entitled: THRIVING: The Gift of the Mormon Faith Crisis.\n Please submit your questions/answers if you are able/willing to do so!!!! I know that this project is going to help many people.",

      "description": "Periodically on Mormon Stories Podcast I try to interview \u201Cnormal\u201D or everyday Mormons about their faith journey \u2013 and in every case these \u201Cnormal\u201D Mormons turn out to be extraordinarily thoughtful and courageous. Today\u2019s interview is no exception to this rule.\n Today on Mormon Stories podcast I am interviewing Kalin Orgill Organ. Aside from Kalin being a super thoughtful and courageous human, Kalin\u2019s story includes several important themes in modern Mormonism:\n  Kalin was raised in an orthodox Mormon home in California and in Highland, Utah \u2013 with seven siblings. She was sexually abused as a child, which possibly awakened her to her own sexuality early than other children. She began masturbating as a girl, before she even knew what the term meant.\u00A0 This instigated a multi-year effort between herself, her parents, and her Mormon bishop to try to stop the behavior, and to become \u201Cworthy\u201D in God\u2019s eyes. Kalin \u201Clost her virginity\u201D as a Mormon teen, which, along with her inability to stop masturbating, only made her feel less worthy.

I am currently being flooded by parents and family members of Mormon missionaries, elderly senior missionaries, patriarchs, temple workers, workers at Deseret Industries, etc. about the Mormon church\u0027s tragically inadequate response to the COVID-19 / Coronavirus outbreak. It appears as though many church leaders, mission presidents, and missionaries are seeing the Corona virus pandemic as an opportunity to corner people in their homes, with hopes of spreading the gospel. It has also come to my attention that Mormon church patriarchs, temple workers (most of whom also fit into the high risk category), and workers at Deseret Industries are still being asked to travel from home to home to give patriarchal blessings, and/or to show up at the temples or at Deseret Industries to work.\n  Please spread the word so we can help the Mormon church keep its members safe.",

      "description": "I have SUPER good news for those of you who have always wanted to attend a Mormon Stories / Faith Crisis Retreat...I have a super cool opportunity.  A generous donor has stepped forward to underwrite the event, and a few other generous folks have offered their St. George homes to us...so here\u0027s the scoop!  1) We are able to make the 12/6-12/8 St. George retreat available to ANYONE who wants to attend. If you cannot afford the registration fee, you are free to pay what you can afford, and the generous donor will cover the rest.  2) We will be driving a retreat karaoke party van down from Salt Lake City on the morning of 12/6, returning the evening of 12/8....so if anyone wants to drive with us...have a blast...and save on transportation, we\u0027d love to have you!  3) Finally, we have several guest rooms available for folks to stay in if you need a place to stay in St. George. If you can pay something for them, great. If you are not able to afford them, that\u0027s ok too!  In summary, PLEASE don\u0027t let finances stop you from attending our Mormon Stories / faith crisis retreat if you are able to come. We will focus on all the important issues including:  1) Navigating a religious faith crisis. 2) Communicating with believing family and friends. 3) Navigating a mixed faith marriage. 4) Improving your mental health during a faith transition. 5) Improving your sexuality during and after a faith transition. 6) Parenting after a faith crisis.  And whatever else you want/need help on.  Please spread the word, and we hope to see many of you you soon!",

      "description": "On 6/30/2019 Mormon Bishop Jared Lusk attended a Mormon church disciplinary council in the Farmington, New Mexico stake on the charges of apostasy. His \u0022sins\u0022 included:\n \u00A0\n 1) Losing his Mormon faith after reading the Mormon church\u0027s own Gospel Topics essays, which discussed topics such as : a) discrepancies in the multiple accounts of Joseph Smith\u0027s first vision, b) Joseph Smith\u0027s polygamy and polyandry, c) concerns about the authenticity of the Book of Mormon and Book of Abraham, etc.\n \u00A0\n 2) Writing publicly about his loss of faith on Facebook, and\n \u00A0\n 3) Supporting Mormon Bishop Sam Young\u0027s efforts to protect Mormon children from sexual abuse.\n \u00A0\n During the disciplinary council Jared\u0027s Mormon Stake President read the charges of apostasy, including several of Jared\u0027s Facebook statements. Then, Jared\u0027s wife, Gwen, along with two of their daughters (Taylor and Madison) testified on Jared\u0027s behalf. Then Jared provided his own response to the charges.\n \u00A0\n At the close of the disciplinary council, Jared\u0027s stake president twice asked Jared explicitly if he would agree to stop commenting on social media about his disbelief in fundamental Mormon truth claims. Both times Jared told his stake president that he would NOT stop expressing his disbelief on social media - explicitly defying the counsel of Jared\u0027s priesthood leadership (which in and of itself is ground for apostasy).\n \u00A0\n In a somewhat unexpected and heretofore unheard of act in the modern area, Jared was informed by his Stake President that he has been Disfellowshipped for Apostasy.",

This episode is a continuation in our series highlight former Mormon bishops and their families who have experienced a faith crisis. Jared is set to be excommunicated on June 30th, 2019 for apostasy (details below).\n The Lusks live in Farmington, New Mexico. Jared and Gwen were raised as devout Mormons, married in the Jordan River temple, had 6 children, and established a successful dental practice in Farmington, NM. Jared and Gwen devoted their lives to the Mormon church for 45\u002B years, including Jared serving as bishop from 2008-2013, and Gwen serving in multiple callings.\n Jared\u2019s faith crisis was triggered in 2015 when he began reading the LDS Gospel Topics Essays.

In this interview Amber shares her experience leaving her religion. From the book\u0027s abstract:\n \u0022Amber\u0027s loss of faith culminated in her own personal apocalypse, the only kind of ending possible for a Jehovah\u0027s Witness.\n \n Shunned by family and friends as an apostate, Amber was alone in Shanghai and thrown into a world she had only known from the periphery--with no education or support system. A coming of age story of a woman already in her thirties, this unforgettable memoir examines what it\u0027s like to start one\u0027s life over again with an entirely new identity. It follows Scorah to New York City, where a personal tragedy forces her to look for new ways to find meaning in the absence of religion. With compelling, spare prose, Leaving the Witness\u00A0traces the bittersweet process of starting over, when everything one\u0027s life was built around is gone.\u0022",

Spencer attended UVSC and BYU, served a mission to San Antonio, Texas, and became an Industrial Designer. Spencer is a renaissance man of sorts. His many talents/interests include karaoke/music, art, travel, design, drawing, landscape architecture, teaching, etc.\n After Spencer was married in the Salt Lake City temple and had two sons, he and his ex-wife eventually experienced a Mormon faith crisis and divorced.\n Today\u2019s episode will cover numerous topics, including Mormon cultural imperialism/whitewashing, being black in the Mormon church, Spencer\u2019s mission, male eating disorders, parenting, divorce, faith crises, and finding identity, morality, and community as a black ex-Mormon man in Utah.",

      "description": "Friends who are: 1) struggling with a Mormon faith crisis, 2) in a Mormon mixed-faith marriage, or 3) struggling with marriage/family issues relating to a Mormon faith crisis As my time is super limited (working on a book!), and my individual faith crisis coaching practice is filled to the brim, AND as I realize that for some people hourly coaching can be pricey - I would like to experiment with a format of doing faith crisis mini-workshops in the Utah/Idaho/Arizona/Colorado areas (or others if interested). This would allow me to support more people, and would allow people within a specific area to make friends and build deeper connections who are close by (thus fostering community). The format would be as follows: - Size of group: 10-12 people, couples and/or individuals welcome. - Date/Time: Any 6 hour block, weekday, weeknight, or weekend. - Possible Topics: Navigating a Mormon faith transition, tips for positive Mental Health, healthy marriages/relationships, communicating with believing family and friends, finding community and/or spirituality during and after a faith crisis, etc. (Basically whatever the group wants to cover) - Location: I could travel to where the group is, or we could find a central location. - Cost: $250/person (6 hours of coaching for around the cost of 1 hour of coaching). It would be particularly meaningful to target specific areas and bring people together who live close to each other (e.g., Alpine, S. Jordan, Provo, Orem, Logan, Ogden, Davis County, SLC, Boise, St. George, Cedar City, Spanish Fork, Park City, Heber/Midway, etc.) If any of you are interested in hosting/organizing such an event, please message me. I would love to support you in this way, and help build local friendships/community at the same time. Thanks in advance! John Dehlin, Ph.D.",

Helen followed this film with a three-hour Frontline documentary for PBS, John Paul II: The Millennial Pope, and in 2007 she produced The Mormons, a four-hour PBS series that explored the richness, complexities and controversies surrounding the Mormon faith. Following the Sept. 11 attacks, she produced Faith and Doubt at Ground Zero, a two-hour documentary that examined how religious belief \u2013 and unbelief \u2013 of Americans was challenged and altered by the spiritual aftershocks of 9/11.\n In Part 2, Helen shares intimate details about the making of the highly-impactful documentary \u0022The Mormons.\u0022 She also provides her non-Mormon perspective of the faith and many anecdotal interactions with LDS General Authorities including Boyd K. Packer, Jeffrey R. Holland, and Gordon B.

      "description": "Join us for this important and time-sensitive edition of Mormon Stories Podcast as we interview Idahoan, Dusty Johns. In Part 1 of this interview,\u00A0Dusty shares his experience growing up as a gay and closeted Mormon and at times being the only active member of his family. Before becoming a missionary, he covenanted with God that if he served an honorable full-time mission that his sexual orientation would change. Upon returning from his mission to England and quickly marrying, a few months into his marriage he realized that he was unable to connect with his wife in a manner that a man and woman should. Though the marriage did not last, it did produce two boys who Dusty treasures and shares parenting responsibilities with their mother. Dusty began to be involved with LDS-affiliated groups that attempt to diminish \u0022same-sex attraction\u0022 and overcome homosexual behavior, but quickly saw that many program attendees were either acting hypocritically or living seemingly miserable lives as celibate Mormons. After experiencing medical complications that almost ended his life, his devotion to the LDS Church and God became cemented and he decided that he could be both an active Mormon, and create a family with someone that he truly loved.\n In Part 2 of this interview, we learn how Dusty met his husband and how the two have formed a loving family unit with Dusty\u0027s two boys. The family was quickly accepted by their local Idahoan ward, including their ward and stake leadership. Dusty tells us that recently his local leadership was directed by LDS Church authorities in Salt Lake City to initiate disciplinary proceedings because of his same-sex marriage. After receiving a letter in the mail indicating such, Dusty forwarded the letter to Mormon Stories Podcast and 6 hours after the letter was posted publicly, his stake leadership was asked to postpone the disciplinary council until after General Conference, as directed by the church\u0027s PR department. \u00A0As of today, Dusty\u0027s council meeting is now set to take place October 16th.",

It places the Smith brothers in the early American context where counterfeiting networks and some of their CEO-like bosses posed as preachers. It is the only book of its kind that uncovers the problems counterfeiters caused in early America and what really happened before, during and after the Book of Mormon appeared on the scene. Her book is both fact-based and fast moving, supported by more than 1400 footnotes and over 100 photos and illustrations. It is also based on nearly 10 years of research, conducted in Vermont, New York, Illinois, Missouri, and Utah.\n In this interview, Kathleen attempts to provide the historical context for the life of the Smith family and the founding of the LDS Church. In particular, we focus on the counterfeiting culture of the time period (Part 1), treasure digging as a practice (Part 2), the origins of the Book of Mormon (Part 3), and finally we delve into how her research and work influences Kathleen\u0027s personal beliefs (Part 4).",

We also learn how some of our panelists found faith in other places, or moved away from religion altogether\u2014all while focusing on how the close-knit Mormon community in Norway influenced their journeys.",

Tom Perry, as well as the sincere struggles with testimony that both Hans and Birgitta faced after his release as an Area Authority.\n In this two-part interview, we relive both Hans and Birgitta\u0027s ascent through the LDS Church, we elaborate for the first time on Hans and Birgitta\u0027s experience receiving the Second Anointing (a rarely-talked about temple ordinance reserved for those in the upper echelons of the LDS Church and described in detail during our epic interview with Tom Phillips), and we discuss the motivations for writing the book, \u0022Truth Seeking: The Story of High-Ranking Mormon Leader Hans Mattsson Seeking Sincere Answers From His Church but Instead Finding Contempt, Fear, Doubt ...and Eventually Peace.\u0022",

      "description": "What would cause a sitting Mormon bishop and his wife to lose their testimonies while he is serving as bishop \u2013 leading him to resign as bishop?\u00A0Jeanne and Jason\u2019s story is another in a series of episodes where we interview past Mormon bishops.\n The two describe raising their four children in the church, their varied callings, and how inextricable Mormonism was in their marriage and worldview.\u00A0Jason\u2019s first call to a bishopric was not one he felt ready or spiritual enough for. Moved by the words of President Hinckley to  \u201CForget yourself and go to work,\u201D he accepted and immediately went to work. \u201CHe was a good bishop,\u201D affirms Jeanne. Jason \u201Cupped his \u2018spiritual game\u2019\u201D by eliminating hard rock from his music collection. Jeanne and their children made similar steps to fit the mold.\n Once called as Bishop, Jason began reading the LDS Gospel Topics Essays, beginning with \u201CRace and the Priesthood,\u201D which caused him to reflect on 2 Nephi Chapter 5 as well as his own experience teaching individuals in New Zealand. \u201CIt shook my confidence in the scriptures. It never occurred to me that prophets could be wrong\u2026in ways that affect people\u2019s lives.\u201D These essays served as the beginning of a series of events that eroded Jason\u2019s testimony.\n Jason was further shaken by being invited to interview as a candidate for Stake President, causing him to wonder if such callings were really the result of inspiration or perhaps the leadership were just ordinary people doing the best they could. Expressing these concerns to Jeanne caused her grief, wondering how her husband could still be a good in person if he left the church.\n Around this time, Jason found Mormon Stories Podcast, which helped him learn more about challenging issues in the church. Issues for Jason began to mount as he learned about individuals who questioned doctrine and did not receive sufficient answers. Jason goes on to describe what it\u2019s like to remain a Bishop after losing confidence in fellow priesthood leaders. As both of their testimonies crumbled, Jeanne and Jason describe being \u201Cheartbroken.\u201D\n What does this bishop do as he, his wife, and his family lose their testimonies?\n Join us now on Mormon Stories Podcast to hear the full story. You will not find more sensitive and thoughtful people than Jeanne and Jason Booth.",

The posts discuss Mormon women\u2019s experiences of wrestling with feminism in a conservative religious tradition. The book highlights individual moments of reflection and faith while tracking the growth and progress of a larger community and religious social movement. Bloggers and community members moved from writing to activism, witnessed the public excommunication of a community member, mourned, and changed. The Feminist Mormon Housewives blog emerged at a time when the broader Mormon feminist movement was in decline. The bloggers shared their discovery of Mormon feminist history, concerns and fears about polygamy, the difficulty of navigating church and family relationships, losing and finding faith, the worst sex talk that ever happened in a church setting, and the awakening of a broader social consciousness. In doing so, they invited a new generation of women into the movement and helped to rebuild it.",

      "description": "Continuing our theme of interviewing past guests from some of our most popular and impactful interviews, we interview Shawn McCraney who first appeared on Mormon Stories in February 2010to discuss his experience as a \u0022Born-Again Mormon.\u0022 \u00A0Shawn currently leads a church in Murray, Utah called C.A.M.P.U.S\u00A0and has continued the ministry through a weekly streaming service, called Heart of the Matter. Shawn is widely known for his bold and sometimes bare-knuckled approach when comparing Mormonism to Christianity, and given his reputation as an animated and articulate speaker, this interview will keep you entertained and perhaps inspired.\n In this interview we cover:\n  Part 1:\u00A0Shawn provides a brief recap of his born-again experience, and then discusses the meteoric rise, and ultimately descent of his tv program Heart of the Matterafter he confronted local Utah Christian churches for focusing more on programs and tithes, and less on the Bible. \u00A0According to Shawn, these churches were providing the same \u0022bondage\u0022 to people as the Mormon Church was. Part 2:\u00A0This segment of the interview is a conversation focusing on Shawn\u0027s theology and beliefs, and Shawn provides a pitch for why a questioning Mormon or post-Mormon should seek the Jesus of the Bible Part 3:\u00A0Shawn describes the \u0022bondage\u0022 he sees when local churches focus more on \u0022religion\u0022 and less on the teachings of Jesus. \u00A0After our\u00A0interview with the South Mountain Community Church\u00A0earlier this year, Shawn voiced concerns to Mormon Stories about our visit and in this segment, we engage in a respectful dialogue about churches such as SMCC and how they serve their congregants.",
