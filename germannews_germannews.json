      "description": "Mike Rinder was quite familiar with the modus operandi of professional anti-Scientologists who seek to profit by making up false media stories relying on the same circle of zealots to \u201Ccorroborate\u201D their bogus claims. In 1998, while serving as a Church spokesman, Rinder explained these tactics to ABC\u2019s 20/20: \u201CThey [anti-Scientologists] sat in a room, they figured out what they were going to say, they wrote their bits, they passed them around, they made sure they were consistent. And yes, they were paid for that.\u201D",
