      "description": "CW: SA, abuse, loss, trauma What happens when the doctrines of faith and control intersect with a woman\u0027s autonomy? In this episode, I sat down with Tia Levings, author of the powerful memoir \u201CA Well-Trained Wife,\u201D and her story will leave you speechless. Tia dives deep into her experience growing up in and escaping from Christian fundamentalism and the trad wife movement\u2014 before it was even called that. We talk about how patriarchal control impacts women financially, emotionally, and physically, and how that same mindset influences the political movements we\u0027re seeing today. If you\u0027ve ever wondered how personal freedom intersects with religion, politics, and financial independence, this is the episode for you.
