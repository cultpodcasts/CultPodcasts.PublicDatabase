      "description": "Dancing For The Devil: The 7M TikTok Cult explores the experiences of a group of prominent TikTok dancers who are trapped in a cult masquerading as a management company. In the process the film uncovers disturbing truths about the agenda of Robert Shinn, the cult\u2019s founder and pastor of the Shekinah Church. Joining Matthew Sherwood on Factual America are executive producers Jessica Acevedo and director Derek Doneen, who discuss the making of the film and the challenges of interviewing people who are still in the depths of an abusive and traumatic environment. The filmmakers explain how it takes a long time to recover from leaving a cult, how to build trust with the people you are documenting, and how the cult responded to the wave of criticism and bad publicity. In the end their film reveals so much about the lure of fame, the importance of faith and the bond of family. Watch the episode at https://factualamerica.com \u201CNobody sets out to join a cult. Cult leaders don\u0027t come at you full blast with their manipulations on display, it\u2019s little by little slowly inching you in over time so you\u2019re not realising what\u2019s happening.\u201D \u2013 Derek Doneen \u201CFinancial abuse and control happened there. It wasn\u2019t until they started sharing some of those experiences that they realised that it was happening to them too and unravelled what they thought was a faith-based positive environment and showed it was really quite sinister.\u201D \u2013 Jessica Acevedo \u201CThe assumption is that people are fine and okay, but continue to dig deeper, ask the questions, have patience and meet people where they\u2019re at because you never really know what someone\u2019s going through. What you see on social media can be one thing but it\u2019s worth asking how they\u2019re doing.\u201D \u2013 Jessica Acevedo",
