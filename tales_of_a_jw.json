Often JW\u2019s try to numb themselves with booze and in the case of our beloved friend it had a bitter ending.\n\n\u2764\uFE0F\u200D\uD83E\uDE79\u2764\uFE0F\u200D\uD83E\uDE79\u2764\uFE0F\u200D\uD83E\uDE79\u2764\uFE0F\u200D\uD83E\uDE79\u2764\uFE0F\u200D\uD83E\uDE79\u2764\uFE0F\u200D\uD83E\uDE79\u2764\uFE0F\u200D\uD83E\uDE79\u2764\uFE0F\u200D\uD83E\uDE79\u2764\uFE0F\u200D\uD83E\uDE79\u2764\uFE0F\u200D\uD83E\uDE79\u2764\uFE0F\u200D\uD83E\uDE79\u2764\uFE0F\u200D\uD83E\uDE79\u2764\uFE0F\u200D\uD83E\uDE79\n\u201CMy hope for all sober alcoholics is that they can begin to feel a sense of pride for the courage they have had in facing their addiction and seeking help. Loved ones can be supportive in terms of giving positive feedback even though there may be lingering resentments. There is always time to work through those issues once the individual is stable emotionally and in their sobriety.\n\nMay shame turn to pride for all of those who are brave enough to admit they are alcoholic and who seek support and treatment!\u201D\n(Benton:l/Psychology Today)\n\nHow can you have help from your family etc when you are disfellowshipped?\n\n\n\n\n\nI hope this video can help anyone who is trying to navigate Through the challenge of leaving a cult and getting out of these entangled situations. \n\n\uD83D\uDC9A\uD83D\uDE31\uD83D\uDEA8 \u0022My Story\u0022 of waking up as a 4th Generation Born-in Jehovah\u0027s Witness started with my Marriage and a Divorce (previous episode: https://youtu.be/Im4es209-7E?si=ILKJITWjmIN8r7Kl )\n\n\u2757\uFE0F\u2757\uFE0F Copyright Disclaimer: - Under section 107 of the copyright Act 1976, allowance is mad for FAIR USE f\nCopyright Disclaimer: - Under section 107 of the copyright Act 1976, allowance is mad for FAIR USE for purpose such a as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship and research.
