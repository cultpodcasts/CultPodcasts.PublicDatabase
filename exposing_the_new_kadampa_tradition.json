Through repetition, these words and phrases ingrain an intense emotional association in the group members\u0027 psyche and shut down arguments and critical thinking to the extent that, after a period of time,  the cult member ends up brainwashing themself.",

Pressure to isolate yourself from friends and family outside of the group.\n2. Requirement to contribute excessive amounts of time and money to the group.\n3. Leadership that is authoritarian and not open to questions or criticism.\n4. Belief that the group is the only path to salvation, enlightenment, etc.\n5. Use of mind-control techniques such as manipulation, gaslighting, or coercion.\n\nSigns that may come later and indicate you are in a cult include:\n\n1. Feeling dependent on the group for your identity and sense of self-worth.\n2. Experiencing fear or anxiety about leaving the group or questioning its beliefs.\n3. Witnessing or experiencing abuse within the group that is justified or ignored by leaders.\n4. Observing a pattern of broken promises or failed prophecies by the group leaders.\n5. Realizing that critical thinking and individuality are discouraged or punished within the group. \n\nIf you have concerns about a particular group or organization you are involved with, it is important to reach out to trusted friends, family members, or mental health professionals for support and guidance.",
