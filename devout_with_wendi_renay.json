Sadly, despite your best efforts to reverse the cycle, your children may be practicing the JW religion\u0027s teaching of shunning, which may be aimed directly at you. \u00A0What do you do? Listen to what Tyler would do differently if given the opportunity and how he turned it all around by a big career change. Now he funnels that pain into helping others through their very real, raw, and painful experiences.\u00A0From Tyler:\u0022I always believed that what I was taught as a child had to be true. But it never made sense, and I always thought there was something wrong with me. After I had children of my own, I couldn\u0027t teach them something that I couldn\u0027t back up myself. So I decided to \u0022make the truth my own,\u0022 and started doing objective research. And nothing could have prepared me for learning the truth.\u0022TO CONTACT TYLER:Finding Paradise:https://linktr.ee/FindingParadiseTwitter - @xjw308IG - tca1101FB - Tyler AhrensFREE DOWNLOAD: https://wendirenaycoaching.com/gameplanTo be on the DevOUT show: https://calendly.com/wendirenay/sharemystory#exjw #mentalhealth #jehovahswitnesses #cultsurvivor #narcissism #religion",

Though he was a little bit smarter a little better than others.Lived in the periphery of society which leads to always feeling left out, unwelcome, less than, or excluded. Without understanding that he felt flawed and like someone who didn\u0027t deserve to belong.He went from s*icidal into #rehab and discovered Bessel Van Der Kolk and Peter Levine\u0027s view on trauma and childhood adaptations and how it manifests in the body and nervous system. And Gabor Mates modality Compassionate Inquiry a somatic-based psychotherapeutic approach. Through this, Joakim began to heal and change the conditioning or actually, the trauma responses that arose and remained from the org and family dynamics to recognize and change the unconscious #beliefs that were residing in the nervous system.Now Joakim has trained in Compassionate Inquiry and works individually and in groups on zoom with #exjws co-creating a safe, compassionate, and accepting relational space to heal the disconnection that initially occurred in relation to parents, family, #god, and the org.
