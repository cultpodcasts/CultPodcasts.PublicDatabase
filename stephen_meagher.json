      "description": "Bonus video this week! I decided to look at some pastors from Africa and react to some of the craziest miracles these pastors claim to heal. It\u0027s insanity and it\u0027s another example of people using religion for money and power. It\u0027s also hilarious to watch some of the claims these pastors make! \n\nIt healed my depression and I hope it helps you too!\n\nThanks for Watching!\n\n#pastor #frauds #religion",

      "description": "In 1968 preacher David Brandt Berg founded a group called Teens for Christ which at first consisted of young runaways and hippies who were so called born again hippies. Over time the church would become the children of god  (now known as the Family International at its peak had 150,000 members around the world.) At the height of its popularity it had members such as River and Joaquin Phoenix, Rose McGowan and Jeremy Spencer who was a founding member of Fleetwood Mac that left the band in 1971 to join the cult. \n\nBerg promotes love and sex with children as young as 5 years of age and committed multiple abuses against his members especially the children.\n\nIn 1976 as an attempt to entice more members, he would use sex to show Gods love and mercy. As a result over 223,989 people were fished and over 10,000 babies were born through cult woman from 1971 to 2001 according to records from the cult and also hilariously enough caused a spread of herpes throughout the cult.  \n\nWoman of the cult were forced to do this whether they wanted to or not.  It was so engrained in their doctrine to do so to spread gods love.\n\nIt was a vile a disgusting cult.\n\nThanks for watching.\n\nPlease like, share and subscribe.\n\n#cult #childrenofgod #religion",

      "description": "Americans know better than anyone what its like to sit down in-front of their TV set and see a pastor passionately tell them, the end is near, God is watching, homosexuality is a sin and more commonly and how imperative it is for them to donate money to their church. \n\nThis phenomenon is known as Televangelism and this tool has been used in attempt to exploit and control since the 1970s. It allowed these pastors into the home of their faithful followers allowing them to reach audiences at unprecedented numbers. \n\nThere are many examples of corrupt pastors who used this medium to extract as much money as possible from their followers. But to me, the most corrupt, disgusting and vile of them all is a man by the name of Kenneth Copeland.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\nPlease like, share and subscribe.\n\n#KCN #pastor #kennethcopeland #christianity",

I would find it hard to believe that their are many people who have not heard of a religion that has one of the biggest celebrities in the world connected to it - Tom Cruise.\n\nScientology is infamous for harassing ex members and pretty much anyone who openly critiques them.  They use psychological warfare to control their members, gaslighting them and manipulating every aspect of their lives. They have vast tax free wealth, in which they use to buy property all over the world. Some would say their power and influence could match that of the Catholic Church.\n\nThanks for watching.\n\n\nSources:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j956WEPpNwE\u0026t=2s\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM-FrI5Hqto\u0026t=1s\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM-FrI5Hqto\u0026t=1s\\\n\nMusic:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svFAjtzijsU\n\n#scientology #tomcruise",

Members were made to believe that terrible consequences awaited them if they disobeyed or left the group.\n\nThis would lead to the horrible mass murder of over 900 people in one of the biggest civilian causulties in American history.\n\nThanks for watching.\n\nPlease like, share and subscribe.\n\n#jimjones #peoplestemple #jonestownmassacure",

      "description": "QAnon is a far-right conspiracy theory that originated on internet message boards in October 2017. It centres around an anonymous individual known as \u0022Q\u0022 who claims to have insider knowledge of a secret global conspiracy involving high-ranking officials and politicians, which they refer to as the \u0022deep state\u0022 or \u0022cabal\u0022. QAnon followers believe that this conspiracy is working to undermine and overthrow the U.S. government, and that Donald Trump is secretly working to expose and defeat it.\n\nThe conspiracy theory is based on a series of cryptic messages posted by \u0022Q\u0022 on internet message boards, which followers interpret as clues to unraveling the supposed conspiracy. QAnon has been linked to several real-world incidents, including the storming of the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, and has been classified by the FBI as a domestic terrorist threat.\nIt\u0027s important to note that QAnon is not based on any credible evidence or facts, and has been widely debunked by experts and fact-checkers. It promotes dangerous and false information, and can lead to real-world harm.\n\nThanks for watching.\n\nPlease like, share and subscribe!\n#conspiracy #trump #documentary #critique",
