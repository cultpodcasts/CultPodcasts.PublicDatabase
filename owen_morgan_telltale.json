      "description": "Is satanism a cult? I talk about 3 denominations of satanism in this video: The Satanic Temple, Laveyan Satanism, and the Order of Nine Angels. Are they largely atheist? Do they actually believe in satan? Let\u0027s talk about it.\n\nNote: Satanism doesnt really have denominations. More like sects.\n\nFollow me on Patreon, Twitter, and Facebook:\nPatreon:  https://www.patreon.com/telltaleatheist\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/telltaleatheist\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/telltaleatheist\n\nMusic: Ether by Silent Partner",

I DON\u0027T BAN PEOPLE FOR COMMENTS UNLESS THEY ADD LINKS OR SPAM. but i\u0027ve noticed people have had trouble commenting on some of my videos lately. i just want to make sure everybody knows that\u0027s not my doing. if you want, you can tweet at me if this happens and we\u0027ll find a solution\n\nthe word \u0022Jehovah\u0022 now makes me cringe.\n\nJehovah\u0027s Witnesses have revealed that they believe the government will turn against them and outlaw their religion specifically. Take a look at their depiction of that scenario. It\u0027s CRAZY with a capital C. for real.\n\nOriginal Video: https://youtu.be/wNtlDybBVA8",
