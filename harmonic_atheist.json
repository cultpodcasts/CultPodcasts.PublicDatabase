      "title": "I escaped a cult of pedophilia and preparing for the apocalypse - Daniella Mestyanek Young",
      "description": "T/W - discussion of child abuse, childhood sexual assault, pedophilia kidnapping, torture, suicide ideation, extreme brainwashing.\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nToday my co-host Summer Biby and I spoke with Daniella Mestyanek Young, a third-generation survivor of an apocalyptic sex cult called the \u0022Children of God,\u0022 which she wrote about extensively in the book \u0022Uncultured.\u0022\n\nWe discussed many topics, including:\n\n\u2022 How David Berg began the apocalyptic cult called \u0022Children of God\u0022 with a strong focus on \u0022sexually liberating children.\u0022\n\u2022 Growing up in a context where the cult actively broke up families, kidnapped children, taught them that \u0022rape is love,\u0022 took away all personal rights, and put everyone under David Berg\u0027s total control.\n\u2022 How the \u0022sacred transcendent assumption\u0022 that David Berg was God\u0027s Prophet created the deprogramming atmosphere where adults, who should have easily known better, ended up allowing and supporting extreme abuse and criminal behavior.\n\u2022 Having the messaging of \u0022self sacrifice\u0022 drilled into her in the cult.\n\u2022 She and the other children being severely disciplined almost nonstop and consequently never having spontaneous moments of joy out of fear that something they said or did would earn punishment -- including severe corporal punishment, sexual assault and solitary confinement.\n\u2022 Observing that cults start to die when the cult leaders fail to successfully indoctrinate the next generation.\n\u2022 Being almost entirely cut off from private time with her own birth mom in a context where all the children had to treat all adults equally as their collective parents most of the time.\n\u2022 Being blamed for accidents from clumsiness and being told that they were part of God\u0027s punishment.\n\u2022 Being driven to disassociate and shut down her emotions to an extreme level, as a survival mechanism.\n\u2022 Being taught that she was lovable only when she was perfect and that she was \u0022nothing without Jesus.\u0022\n\u2022 Intentionally choosing to raise the next generation without fear, pain, and violence.\n\u2022 Being told that David Berg was \u0022the\u0022 end times prophet from God and they needed to be ready for Jesus\u0027 imminent return.\n\u2022 Reading stories of Christian martyrs and fantasizing about being killed for Jesus by the Antichrist.\n\u2022 Going through training drills for how to survive and deal with the end times and Tribulation as they prepared to be \u0022God\u0027s insurgency.\u0022\n\u2022 Realizing that, in the context of apocalyptic cults, that cult leaders precipitate their own apocalypse because they want the world to burn, to find a way to prove themselves right.\n\nMany thanks to Daniella for sharing her story and for her amazing voice and strength through all she does for the community!\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nConnect with Daniella!\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Uncultured-Memoir-Daniella-Mestyanek-Young/dp/125083547X/\n\nhttps://www.uncultureyourself.com/\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/Daniellamyoung\n\nTiktok\n@daniellamestyanekyoung\n\nIG\n@daniellamyoung_\n\nTwitter\n@daniellamyoung \n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nConnect with Summer!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@summerbiby1496/videos\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nPlease subscribe to my other channels (many more channels and videos coming soon!)\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/harmonicatheist\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nTim may be reached by email at: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.\n\nOne time\nPayPal (preferred):      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nZelle email: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nMonthly\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nEnding music by Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n\n_________________________________________",

      "description": "Today I spoke with Scott Homan, a former Jehovah\u0027s Witness (JW) and the Director of the new documentary \u0022Witness Underground,\u0022 which tells the story of several ex-JW\u0027s as they share the pain of questioning their worldview and use music as a way to express the amazing journey of deconversion.\n\nWe touched on many topics, including:\n\n\u2022 Being told that Jesus was going to come back soon and personally kill everyone who was not a JW.\n\u2022 Hearing that Jesus is in Jehovah\u0027s throne room doing the work of Jehovah but that the main relationship and the direction of prayer was to Jehovah, not Jesus.\n\u2022 Being told to not be formulaic with his prayers, but still being given ritual prayers to say.\n\u2022 Hearing the preaching of physical immortality promised to those who remained consistently faithful to Jehovah.\n\u2022 Never feeling secure in his \u0022salvation\u0022 because there was always the threat that he was not doing enough and would fall away.\n\u2022 Seeing people shamed in public for failure to follow all the rules or for having a questionable witness.\n\u2022 Hearing fellow JWs talk joyfully about non-believers soon being \u0022blasted\u0022 by Jesus and how they, the witnesses, would help clear the land of the carcasses.\n\u2022 Being told from some family that his deceased grandfather was in heaven, and from other family that his grandfather had been annihilated.\n\u2022 Being told that he could lose eternal life both during his life here and during the future kingdom.\n\u2022 Starting to study evolution even though it had been described as a satanic belief.\n\u2022 Finally admitting that Bible stories are fantasy lore and make believe.\n\u2022 Being completely shunned by his family after he deconverted.\n\u2022 Realizing that most Christians are exceptionally fragile in both their faith and their emotions.\n\u2022 The importance of Christians needing to have a \u0022unified\u0022 faith where dissent is strongly discouraged.\n\u2022 How the freedom to create lyrics and music led to freethought for many JWs.\n\u2022 Seeing those who escaped slowly influencing those still stuck in the cult, even from a distance.\n\u2022 Realizing that getting out of the JW cult is like leaving an extremely abusive relationship.\n\u2022 The background and goals of the Witness Underground documentary where JWs share their stories, face intense shunning, reclaim their identities, and rebuild their identities post-deconversion, all centered around their music.\n\nMany thanks to Scott for sharing his story and for his amazing work in the Witness Underground documentary!\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nConnect with Scott and the documentary:\n\nhttps://www.witnessunderground.com/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@WitnessUnderground/videos\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/witnessunderground\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/WitnessUnderground/\n\nInstagram\n @witnessunderground  \n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nPlease subscribe to my other channels (many more channels and videos coming soon!)\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/harmonicatheist\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nTim may be reached by email at: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.\n\nOne time\nPayPal (preferred):      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nZelle email: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nMonthly\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n\n_________________________________________",

      "description": "*** Trigger warning: sexual assault, child abuse and exploitation, childhood rape, pedophilia, suicide.\n\n____________________________________\n\nToday I spoke with Angel DeSantis, who grew up in the \u0022Children of God\u0022 Christian sex cult, but ultimately escaped as she examined the truth claims of the group, and of Christianity in general, and reclaimed her identity.\n\nWe discussed many topics, including: \n\n\u2022 Being indoctrinated to believe that the Antichrist and the End Times were coming very soon and that she was part of the Lord\u0027s End Time army.\n\u2022 Being told to prepare for rape by the Antichrist\u0027s soldiers, but to use that as a means to seduce them to believe in Jesus.\n\u2022 Seeing older women being sent out to do \u0022Flirty Fishing\u0022 to seduce men sexually and then invite them to become involved in the cult.\n\u2022 Being taught that your body belongs to the collective cult community, and consent was assumed.\n\u2022 Receiving punishment for being kind toward her own sister, as a means to push the narrative that the entire community was as important as her immediate family.\n\u2022 Hearing the Christian message of the Gospel of forgiveness of sin through Jesus altered into a works salvation message, focused primarily on whether the cult leaders where pleased with you.\n\u2022 Seeing the cult leaders portray the known Christian characters (such as Yahweh, Jesus, the Holy Spirit, the Angel Gabriel, the Virgin Mary) in hyper-sexual terms.\n\u2022 How the cult grooming process led to parents failing to see the danger or to protect their own children.\n\u2022 How their worldview about god was highly authoritarian, where he was easily displeased with people, based on the cult leaders\u0027 perspectives.\n\u2022 How the Yahweh character is shown as promising unconditional love yet with overwhelming conditions.\n\u2022 How Christianity keeps people deeply stuck in cognitive dissonance because confused people are easier to control.\n\u2022 How \u0022purity culture\u0022 in the cult was reversed, encouraging women to show as much skin as possible and encouraging young men to \u0022claw at\u0022 a woman\u0027s body.\n\u2022 Hearing women being encouraged to not fight rape, but to see it as part of the will and plan of god.\n\u2022 How the ultra-patriarchal and misogynistic mentalities of the cult saw women primarily as sex objects and childbearing objects.\n\u2022 The extreme sheltering the cult imposed on members, so much that people who chose to leave would find their quality of life so poor that they would be compelled to return.\n\u2022 Seeing all other Christians as foolish and unliberated.\n\u2022 Being taught that heaven was basically an orgy scene.\n\u2022 The importance of being self-aware enough to see red flags in our lives, worldviews, and relationships so that we can be mentally healthy and pass on healthiness to the next generation.\n\u2022 The importance of autonomy and logical thinking in escaping fundamentalist religions.\n\u2022 The importance of \u0022setting a bar\u0022 that thoughts need to be 1) true and 2) useful, in order to be thoughts we are willing to entertain ... and rejecting any which don\u0027t meet that criteria.\n\u2022 Slowly walking toward things that lead you to peace and health, and away from toxic ideas.\n\u2022 How the Christian narrative actively degrades your sense of self.\n\u2022 After deconversion, the importance of building yourself from ground zero as you discover and create your identity apart from the cult worldview.\n\nMany thanks to Angel for sharing her story!\n\n\n____________________________________\n\nConnect with Angel!\n\nwww.angeldesantis.com\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@AngelDeSantis\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@angeldesantis3641/videos\n\n____________________________________\n\nLearn more about the \u0022Children of God\u0022 Christian sex cult:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@childrenofgodcultdocumentr9813/videos\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\n*** Please subscribe to my other channels ***\n(many more channels and videos coming soon!)\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/harmonicatheist\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nTim may be reached by email at: harmonicatheist@yahoo.com\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nYour support for my channel, Harmonic Atheist, is very appreciated.\n\nMonthly\nhttps://www.patreon.com/harmonicatheist\n\nOne time\nPayPal:      paypal.me/harmonictim\nVenmo:      @harmonicatheist\nGoFundMe:     https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tim-stay-full-time-on-harmonic-atheist\n\nThanks!\n\n--Tim\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nEnding music by Eyal Raz, \u0022Friends\u0022\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbqNO6DdAQ\n\n_________________________________________",
