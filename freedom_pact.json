She was raised on a mountain in the Angeles National Forest where she learned to identify flora and fauna, navigate by the stars, forage for edible plants, and care for the earth. Her memoir, Forager: Field Notes on Surviving a Family Cult, showcases her life growing up on an isolated mountain in California as part of an apocalyptic cult, and how she found her way out of poverty and illness by drawing on the gifts of the wilderness.\n\n\nTimestamps:\n0:00 The Cult Leader\n14:30 Cult Believes\n16:30 Cut-off From The Real World\n19:00 Life On The Mountain\n30:00 Learning To Forage\n35:20 Relationships In The Cult \n38:00 Psychological Impact\n44:00 Leaving The Cult \n\nConnect with us:\nhttps://freedompact.co.uk/newsletter\u200B (Healthy, Wealthy \u0026 Wise Newsletter)\ntwitter.com/freedompactpod  \nEmail: freedompact@gmail.com \nhttps://Tiktok.com/personaldevelopment\n\nConnect with Michelle:\nhttps://mdowd.substack.com/\nhttps://www.michelledowd.org/\n\nFind the book here: https://www.amazon.com/dp/1643755773?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_N5YH96GYNS595Y3TYVG2",
