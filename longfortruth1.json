      "description": "Are the cessationists right when they say that the Charismatic gifts ceased by the end of the apostolic age, or, are the continuationists right for believing that the Charismatic gifts are still in operation today? In this episode we discuss chapter 1 of the book \u0022An Evaluation of Claims to the Charismatic Gifts\u0022 by Douglas Judisch. \n\nYou can buy Judisch\u0027s book here:\n\nhttps://bookstore.ctsfw.edu/evaluation-claims-charismatic-gifts\n4/12/22 Update:  The link for Judisch\u0027s book is currently working! \n\nChapter One\nThe Means of Authentication\n13 Theses\n\n1. Utterance in unlearned tongues by the power of the Spirit is, like prophecy, utterance in words taught by God.\n\n2. Words taught by God demand from us complete acceptance and obedience.\n\n3. But not all utterances represented as being words taught by God actually are such.\n\n4. Utterances that are represented as being words taught by God when they actually are not such demand from us rejection.\n\n5. It is therefore essential to test carefully all utterances that are represented as being words taught by God, accepting and obeying those that pass the test and rejecting those that do not.\n\n6. If an utterance represented as being words taught by God has received the personal sanction of an apostle or of a man personally authenticated as a prophet by an apostle, we can conclude that the utterance actually is words taught by God.\n\n7. We know of no other test by which we could determine if an utterance represented as being words taught by God actually is such.\n\n8. We dare not conclude, therefore, that any utterance represented as being words taught by God actually is such if it has not received the personal sanction of an apostle or of a man personally authenticated as a prophet by an apostle.\n\n9. But no utterance of post-apostolic times can receive the personal sanction of an apostle.\n\n10. Nor do we know of any case in which a man personally authenticated as a prophet by an apostle gave his personal sanction, after the death of the apostles, to an utterance represented as being words taught by God or to the claim of another man to be a prophet.\n\n11. We dare not conclude, therefore, that any utterance of postapostolic times represented as being words taught by God actually is such.\n\n12. Any utterance of post-apostolic times represented as being words taught by God, therefore, demands from us rejection. (required by 5 and 11)\n\n13. We conclude therefore that any utterance of post-apostolic times represented as being prophecy or utterance in unlearned tongues by the power of the Spirit must be rejected. (follows from these 1 and 12)\n\nHere is a link to where you can get the Pirate Christian t-shirt I\u0027m wearing:\n\nhttps://www.moteefe.com/store/pirate-christian-merch/fighting-for-the-faith-context-context-context?color=black\u0026product=men-s-t-shirt\n\n\nYou can reach us at longfortruth1@gmail.com, or on Facebook at \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/LongForTruth \n\nScripture quotations are from The ESV\u00AE Bible (The Holy Bible, English Standard Version\u00AE), copyright \u00A9 2001 by Crossway, a publishing ministry of Good News Publishers.

      "description": "Word of Faith/ NAR teachers like Todd White and Bill Johnson are teaching that God is not in control of everything. While they would say that He is sovereign, their definition of sovereign goes like this \u201CGod may be in charge, but He\u2019s not in control. He does not bring about sickness and death. Sickness and death are works of the devil since the devil came to steal, kill and destroy.\u201D \n\nWhile at times the Bible does mention that the devil causes affliction, he has no authority to do so unless God allows it. God rules over Satan, not the other way around. God is sovereign, He is in control over all of His creation, including Satan. \n\nIn this video, we look at what these false teachers are saying about the sovereignty of God and compare what they are saying with Scripture.\n\nHere is the link to the MUC article with the downloadable PDF: \n\nhttps://www.themessedupchurch.com/blog/a-biblical-guide-to-the-sovereignty-of-god",

One of the ways to identify leaders and their followers (NARites) in this movement, is by paying attention to the terminology or buzzwords they use. Some of the words in this list are biblical, but the meaning and application are far removed from what scripture actually teaches (biblical terminology to gives credence to their aberrant doctrines) Certain words used in the NAR appear to be sci-fi or computer buzzwords, and their applications originate in the minds of the false apostles and prophets that drive this movement. The words listed are not exclusive to the NAR, but occur in some Charismatic, Word of Faith and other movements.\u0022 Rick Becker\n\nHere is the article that Rick and I discussed:\n\nhttps://fitl.co.za/2020/04/29/a-glossary-of-new-apostolic-reformation-terminology/\n\nHere is the link to the MUC podcast:\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-messed-up-church/id1541494645\n\nHere is the link to Considering Context:\n\nhttps://www.spreaker.com/show/considering-context",

She was known as \u201Cthe trance evangelist,\u201D because during her meetings she would go into trances and see visions of heaven and hell. One newspaper reporter sarcastically wrote that she had more visions, and worked more miracles than all the apostles combined! \n\nPeople in her audience would also fall into trances, some standing rigid gazing into heaven, others lying on the floor unable to move for hours or even days. Screaming, crying, singing, moaning, violent shaking, and people rolling around on the floor were just some of the strange occurrences that were common in her meetings. Unfortunately, these strange manifestations were and still are blamed on the Holy Spirit. \n\nIn his book \u201CGod\u2019s Generals, Roberts Liardon calls Etter \u201Ca demonstrator of the Spirit,\u201D spreading the fire of the Holy Spirit. \n\n\u201CShe was an incredible woman of vision and spiritual strength who stood in the face of fierce opposition lifted her tiny hand, and allowed the Holy Spirit to spread His fire.\u201D\n\nBut Etter was no demonstrator of the Holy Spirit.

On the ship was 17 year old Carol Goodenough. \nShe was returning to the States by the direction of her brother to go to school. Lake\u0027s late wife Jennie and Carol were friends. Jennie died only 6 months after arriving in South Africa. \n\nAfter Jennie\u0027s death in December of 1908, Lake became engaged to Ada White. Ada died from malaria that same year. Shortly after Ada\u0027s death, Lake became engaged to Carol Goodenough. He was 38, she was 17. \n\nThese early newspaper articles from 1909 tell the story of an affair that Lake\u0027s biographers didn\u0027t want anyone to know about.\n\nYou can read the full article related to this video over at \u0022The Messed Up Church.\u0022 \n\n https://www.themessedupchurch.com/blog/john-g-lakes-clandestine-affair",

      "title": "Proof that John G. Lake Was a Fraud!",
      "description": "John Graham Lake 1870-1935 was a leader in the early Pentecostal movement. In 1914 he started \u201CThe Divine Healing Institute,\u201D as well as opening up what he called \u201Chealing rooms.\u201D He ran these \u201Chealing rooms\u201D from 1915- 1920. He was a \u201Cfaith healer\u201D and Pastor of \u201CThe Church of Portland.\u201D In 1999 Cal Pierce re-opened Lake\u2019s \u201Chealing rooms\u201D in Spokane Washington.\n\n\n Lake is held up by popular Charismatic leaders to be a great man of God, who performed over 100,000 healings in his time. Yet all one has to do is a little digging to find out that this isn\u2019t the case at all. John G. Lake was actually a liar, a con, and a fraud. \n\nFor example, Lake was convicted of \u201CBlue Sky Fraud,\u201D which landed him and his son Otto in jail. He used his church as a platform to sell stock to his parishioners from his mining schemes, even swindling $1000.00 from one couple. \n\nThen, there were the healing meetings. There is no evidence that any of the healings Lake claimed to perform were genuine. For example, a newspaper article called \u201CMiracles Not Seen,\u201D reported that most of the people who did receive healing seemed to be hypochondriacs, while others with crutches and wheelchairs received no healing at all. \n\nIn this video, I present 3 newspaper articles proving, undeniably that Lake was nothing more than a fraud. I put the links to the original articles in the YouTube description. \n\n\nHere are the links to the newspaper articles:\n\nhttps://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83045782/1921-07-24/ed-1/seq-8/#index=1\u0026rows=20\u0026proxtext=Blue\u002BSky\u002BFraud\u0026searchType=basic\u0026sequence=0\u0026words=BLUE\u002BFRAUD\u002BSKY\u0026page=1\n\n\n\nhttps://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83025138/1920-05-24/ed-1/seq-4/#index=1\u0026rows=20\u0026proxtext=%22Miracles\u002BNot\u002BSeen%22\u0026searchType=basic\u0026sequence=0\u0026words=MIRACLES\u002BSEEN\u0026page=1\n\n\nhttps://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83045782/1921-11-27/ed-1/seq-14/#sort=relevance\u0026index=6\u0026rows=20\u0026words=G\u002BJohn\u002BLake\u0026searchType=basic\u0026sequence=0\u0026proxtext=%22John\u002BG.\u002BLake%22\u0026page=4",

Dan Long shares a clip from Bethel \u0022pastor\u0027 Bill Johnson who claims to see the appearance of a  \u0022glory cloud\u0022 in a Friday night conference, and then plays an alleged encounter that Kim Walker-Smith, one of the \u0022worship leaders\u0022 from Jesus Culture, had with Jesus.",

      "description": "Source:\nhttp://www.spreaker.com/user/4903048/how_to_hear_god_speak\n\nWhy are so many Christians looking for a \u0022word\u0022 from God outside of the only means He has given to speak to us? The Bible ALONE is the way in which God speaks. And yet even prominent evangelical teachers like Beth Moore have replaced the sufficiency of the Scriptures with esoteric experience.\n\nIn this episode Dan Long discusses The sufficiency of the Bible and talks about the neo Gnostic book \u0022Jesus Calling\u0022, as well as the supposed vision that Beth Moore received from Christ which includes the apostate Roman Catholic Church.",
