      "description": "Mahrs Schoppman - The Colonization of our BodiesDivorced: Evangelical Christianity Mahrs Schoppman is a queer \u0026 trans somatic psychotherapist with a private practice based out of his home office in the redwood trees of Occidental, California. Mahrs specializes in working with the queer community and with those who live with the embodied traumatic impacts of growing up in an oppressive religious environment. \u00A0He is passionate about walking with people on their journeys of reclaiming embodied knowing, sensation, emotional range, and vitality as a means of recovering from the learned dissociation that comes with restrictive religion.\u00A0 Mahrs facilitates therapy groups for queer survivors of religious trauma and is in the midst of writing a book about his experiences and ideas around religious trauma. \u00A0On today\u2019s episode, Mahrs shares his gripping extimony about coming out as a nonbeliever and member of the LGBTQ\u002B community, and how his own experience informs his private practice.For more from Mahrs, join us at CORT2023.Tickets now available: https://www.religioustraumaconference.org/FIND MAHRS: https://therapywithmahrs.com/Support this podcast on Patreon (starting as low as $2/month) and get access to bonus content: https://www.patreon.com/janiceselbie Thanks to my newest patrons: Hayley, Lois, SatX.
