This Organization screams cult! And you will remain in this cult if you don\u2019t apply my principles.\n\nIf you\u2019ve watched this video I want to thank you for your patience and dedication to watch and support me.\n\nHelp me expose this cult! #share this video: https://youtu.be/nwJtRcJkVaA\n\nThey sexually #abuse kids, they force #children into #slavery, they hold families hostage and #shun smart people, who they like to call #apostates. Anyone who follows #jesus is condemned.\n\nThis #religion #organization \u0026 #brotherhood I defended for 30\u002B years must be put down! I do not attack because I am #evil. Nor do I do this in #retaliation. This is purely #educational, #informative, #beneficial, and may just be #lifesaving! Please #share and help the cause!!\n\nMy Website: https://www.exjwmj.com/\n\nFOLLOW ON TIKTOK: ExJw MJ In Context\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@exjwmjincontext?_t=8gxn8fxTlsp\u0026_r=1\n\n\n\uD83D\uDD0C Let\u2019s connect:\n\n\u2709\uFE0F Email \u2013 LMXJW27@GMAIL.COM\n\n\uD83C\uDF10 Tiktok \u2013 ExJw MJ In Context\n\n\u2764\uFE0F Support the channel:\n\n\uD83D\uDCB2Donate @\n\nCashapp - $iblulu\nPaypal - lulu27\n\n\n#exjwcriticalthinker #cult #organizedreligion\n#freedomfromreligion #followerofchrist",
