      "description": "Cults are not always whacky organised communities that live in a commune... in fact, many modern-day cults exist right under our noses. New-age spiritual gurus have gentrified many of the legitimate practices of the East, like meditation and yoga, and used them to gain the trust of vulnerable individuals.

Her life was never normal; she had no TV, was forced out of school before High School and she could not date or mingle with boys - any semblance of a normal teenage childhood was banned.Her life changed forever when she had just turned 18 and Warren Jeffs requested her to be married to him, as one of his then 64 wives. Briell\u0027s father brought her to the leader, and she was married instantly. Briell spent the next 8 years under the control of the FLDS Church, where she was drugged to keep quiet and all measures were taken to keep her within the organisation. This is her story, on how she escaped and how she took the power back.Watch her TedTalk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWmsoCIuDn4\u0026ab_channel=TEDxTalks--- Send in a voice message: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/redroompod/message Hosted on Acast.
