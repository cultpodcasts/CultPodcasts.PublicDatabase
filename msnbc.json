      "description": "Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley dropped out of the Republican primary after winning only Vermont on Super Tuesday. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) joins Andrea, Ana, and Jose to share his reaction and discuss the presumptive Biden-Trump rematch in November. \u201CMy assumption was that, of the Constitution itself, which is that someone who participates in an insurrection against the union should never be allowed to hold office again,\u201D Raskin says. \u201CAnd it is disgraceful that a great political party, much less Abraham Lincoln\u0027s party, a party of liberty and union, should be reduced to a cult of authoritarian personality in league with autocrats and kleptocrats and dictators all over the world.\u201D\n\n\u00BB Subscribe to MSNBC: https://www.youtube.com/msnbc\n \nFollow MSNBC Show Blogs \nMaddowBlog: https://www.msnbc.com/maddowblog\nReidOut Blog: https://www.msnbc.com/reidoutblog\n\nMSNBC delivers breaking news, in-depth analysis of politics headlines, as well as commentary and informed perspectives.
