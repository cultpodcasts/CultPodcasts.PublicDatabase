      "title": "\uD83E\uDD70 Amy\u0027s Sex Life in the Sea Org - What Scientology Doesn\u0027t Want You to Know",
      "description": "I was in the Sea Org for 25 years. During that time, I had sex with 3 people: my first husband of 6 years (David Paul), my 2nd husband of 17 years (Jim Mortland) and Mat Pesch (just before we left the Sea Org together and got married on 13 March 2005.)  So, in 44 years now (and counting), I\u0027ve only had sex with 3 people and they were all my husbands.  This fact goes against Scientology\u0027s campaign against me, which is almost exclusively that I was a repeat adulteress - \u0022a serial sexual deviant who broke up marriages with her wanton adulteress affairs.\u0022\n\nIf not already done, please SUBSCRIBE to receive notification of my newest material or JOIN to receive special perks. \n\nAlso, visit my website at www.Scobee-Publishing.com where you can order a signed paperback edition of my book, SCIENTOLOGY - ABUSE AT THE TOP (digital downloads are also available there).\n\nYou can support Amy\u0027s work to expose Scientology here:  https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/scobe...\n\nFor  The Aftermath Foundation, use this link:\nhttps://theaftermathfoundation.org\n\nThank you for being here!
