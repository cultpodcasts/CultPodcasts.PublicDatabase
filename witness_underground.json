Music, fame, and success are typically forbidden in this group, which instructs its members to \u201Cbeware of independent thinking.\u201D\n\nThe artists at the heart of the music scene have their faith tested. They battle for mental health and push the boundaries of their religion\u2019s norms, where leaving means being banned from interacting with your entire family and social circle for life.\n\nAlthough severely restricted, they create the record label Nuclear Gopher and produced over 30 albums of earnest and personal music that spans: singer/songwriter, riot grrrl, psychedelic rock, pop, EDM, shoegaze, and post-rock. Carefully curated performances punctuate their stories of friendship, deep loss, and personal growth.\n\nLong Pitch:\nIn suburban Minneapolis, upstanding Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses are arriving home after hours of doorbell ringing and front doors slamming.\n\nBut not Cindy, or the elder staring down this teenager.\nOr the man she lost her virginity to hours ago in a hotel.\n\n\u201CDid you start it? Did you touch him?\u201D, the elder asks.\n\n\u201CDid you have an orgasm?\u201D\n\nShe played a show that week. A coffee shop Witnesses flocked to.\n\nShe plucked strings to her pop-punk anthem.\nShe belted out the words her spirit had tried to hide.\nHer \u0022Prayer To No One\u0022 ricocheted off the walls to a riveted crowd.\n\nThey wanted an encore.\nShe knew a private punishment wasn\u2019t going to be enough.\nShe went back for more.\n\nWitness Underground unveils an unexplored music community surviving within a dystopia. Humanizing the struggle, courage, and artistry of former members.\n\nFrom home-brew music videos to grand pop-up festivals over 17 years and 30 albums. Art becomes more than self-expression; it is awakening, healing, and freedom from their trauma. \u0022Frequently searing and undeniably confrontational.\u201D [Tone Madison Music Magazine]\n\nLong Synopsis:\nA chilling, yet empowering social impact documentary, Witness Underground highlights the music and defection of doomsday cult members and the consequences of self-expression. A \u201Cunique look, with unwavering access, inside the complexities of faith, and the bond forged between artists.\u201D [Amir George, Film and Art Programmer, True/False Film Festival.] \n\nNuclear Gopher, an underground indie record label, arose within their dystopia as a safe space for a few hundred born-in artists to express themselves. Witness the history of their most prolific underground bands as they navigated in the shadows of a high-control society. \n\nFrom homebrew music videos to pop-up music festivals this community created earnest, multi-genre, secular music, as a means of waking up, and processing trauma. \u0022Frequently searing and undeniably confrontational\u0022 [Tone Madison] As outcasts they expose the losses of community and family. Their music is more than just an outlet for self-expression but a powerful tool to heal.",

Music, fame, and success are typically forbidden in this group, which instructs its members to \u201Cbeware of independent thinking.\u201D\n\nThe artists at the heart of the music scene have their faith tested. They battle for mental health and push the boundaries of their religion\u2019s norms, where leaving means being banned from interacting with your entire family and social circle for life.\n\nAlthough severely restricted, they create the record label Nuclear Gopher and produced over 30 albums of earnest and personal music that spans: singer/songwriter, riot grrrl, psychedelic rock, pop, EDM, shoegaze, and post-rock. Carefully curated performances punctuate their stories of friendship, deep loss, and personal growth.\n\nLong Pitch:\nIn suburban Minneapolis, upstanding Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses are arriving home after hours of doorbell ringing and front doors slamming.\n\nBut not Cindy, or the elder staring down this teenager.\nOr the man she lost her virginity to hours ago in a hotel.\n\n\u201CDid you start it? Did you touch him?\u201D, the elder asks.\n\n\u201CDid you have an orgasm?\u201D\n\nShe played a show that week. A coffee shop Witnesses flocked to.\n\nShe plucked strings to her pop-punk anthem.\nShe belted out the words her spirit had tried to hide.\nHer \u0022Prayer To No One\u0022 ricocheted off the walls to a riveted crowd.\n\nThey wanted an encore.\nShe knew a private punishment wasn\u2019t going to be enough.\nShe went back for more.\n\nWitness Underground unveils an unexplored music community surviving within a dystopia. Humanizing the struggle, courage, and artistry of former members.\n\nFrom home-brew music videos to grand pop-up festivals over 17 years and 30 albums. Art becomes more than self-expression; it is awakening, healing, and freedom from their trauma. \u0022Frequently searing and undeniably confrontational.\u201D [Tone Madison Music Magazine]\n\nLong Synopsis:\nA chilling, yet empowering social impact documentary, Witness Underground highlights the music and defection of doomsday cult members and the consequences of self-expression. A \u201Cunique look, with unwavering access, inside the complexities of faith, and the bond forged between artists.\u201D [Amir George, Film and Art Programmer, True/False Film Festival.] \n\nNuclear Gopher, an underground indie record label, arose within their dystopia as a safe space for a few hundred born-in artists to express themselves. Witness the history of their most prolific underground bands as they navigated in the shadows of a high-control society. \n\nFrom homebrew music videos to pop-up music festivals these groups created earnest, multi-genre, secular music, as a means of waking up, and processing trauma. \u0022Frequently searing and undeniably confrontational\u0022 [Tone Madison] As outcasts they expose the losses of community and family. Their music is more than just an outlet for self-expression but rather as a powerful tool to heal.",

      "description": "Decult Cult Awareness Conference \u0026 New Documentary. Check out the Live Campaign!\r\n\r\nhttps://www.boosted.org.nz/projects/decult-documentary\r\n\r\nAustralasia will host its first ever cult awareness conference in October. Tickets, newsletter and info: https://www.decult.net\r\n\r\nExperts and survivors will meet in Christchurch to highlight how cults work, and the harm they cause.\r\n\r\nThe conference is called Decult, and is being organised by journalist and author of Cult Trip: Inside the World of Coercion and Control, Anke Richter, an Author, reporter and cult researcher.\r\n\r\nThe Aim:\r\nDecult 2024 is a pioneering conference that addresses the pervasive harm inflicted by high-control groups in New Zealand. By giving cult survivors a voice and bringing experts from various fields together, they\u2019re creating a unique opportunity for mental health professionals, government departments, law enforcement and first responders to offer better support and prevent cultic harm in the future. The aim is to develop lasting networks for professionals and to present ongoing events. More cult awareness will improve the wellbeing of vulnerable individuals.\r\n\r\nThe Conference:\r\nSpend a weekend with authors and educators, academics and counsellors, survivors and their advocates as they share their expertise and personal stories. Decult is for anyone interested in spirituality, religion or personal growth who wants to engage in respectful discussion to broaden their knowledge \u2013 especially health professionals and frontline services helping cult victims: How does recruitment work, what are the signs of coercive control, how can people get out, and how can they recover?\r\n\r\nRegardless of their background, faith or belief system, attendees will leave with a deeper understanding of harmful dynamics in cult-like groups and how to support cult leavers better. This thought-provoking event will be a forum for those who left their communities to connect with others and feel heard and seen. Let\u2019s show them that we care.\r\n\r\nThe Documentary:\r\nAward-winning film makers Robyn Jordaan and Caleb MacDonald have an ambitious plan to create a documentary about the Decult 2024 Conference in October. As this is the first cult awareness conference of its kind in Australasia, they\u2019re creating a resource that can long outlive the conference. \r\n\r\nTheir film will include interviews with our speakers \u2013 authors, educators, counsellors, academics and survivors \u2013 sharing their expertise and personal stories. It is our hope that audiences will gain a deeper understanding of harmful dynamics in cult-like groups, how to prevent them, and how to support cult leavers better. \r\n\r\nThis amount will allow them to produce a 20-30 minute documentary which showcases the conference and also features interviews with speakers and survivors.\r\n\r\nThe funding goal allows us to cover the basic costs of creating the documentary and recaps (transport, filming, production tasks, marketing fees). The stretch goal will provide additional creative support for the conference and the Decult Charitable Trust.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t have the ability to contribute? You could consider spreading the word. Share this link: https://www.boosted.org.nz/projects/decult-documentary\r\n\r\nCheck out the Decult website founded by renouned author of Cult Trip, Anke Richter. https://www.decult.net\r\n\r\nCult Recovery Conference \u0026 Training\r\n\r\nDECULT 2024 is a ground-breaking cult awareness conference with international experts, cult survivors and victim advocates to address a critical gap and reduce harm. We\u2019re especially inviting psychologists, therapists and counsellors. Keynote speaker Dr Gillie Jenkinson, a UKCP accredited psychotherapist specialising  in coercive control, religious trauma and group-based abuse, will offer additional two- and five-day workshops in post-cult recovery for mental health professionals after the Decult conference. This is a first in NZ.\r\n\nJoin us on October 19-20, 2024, in Christchurch, where journalists, authors, and cult researchers like Anke Richter will delve into the insidious workings of high-control groups.\n\nDecult 2024 aims to shed light on the lasting harm caused by cults. Survivors and experts will convene to share stories and insights, empowering mental health professionals, law enforcement, and frontline responders to better assist those affected by coercive control.\n\nThe conference promises a weekend of learning and connection, featuring renowned speakers like Dr. Gillie Jenkinson, a psychotherapist specializing in cult recovery. Dive into topics such as recruitment tactics, signs of control, and pathways to recovery.\n\nThe documentary will capture the essence of Decult 2024 to amplify survivor voices and educate audiences on identifying and supporting victims of cultic abuse.\n\nJoin the movement to combat cultic harm. Consider supporting the documentary campaign. Together, we can raise awareness and promote healing for survivors of coercive groups.",

Explore the phenomenon of High Control religion. We\u0027re diving into what organizational psychologist, Stephen Mather, has learned from hosting 267 episodes with former cult members, and cult experts around the world, with deep journalistic and academic integrity.\r\n\r\nDive in with Witness Underground as we uncover the intriguing world of global cults, exploring cults in America and the UK, guided by none other than Stephen Mather, the host of the acclaimed UK podcast, Cult Hackers.\r\n\r\nCult Hackers Podcast has always been about trying to understand the phenomenon of cults and High Control, as well as listen to people\u2019s stories. Stephen is an activist against any one particular group. His goal is to understand the psychological processes at work and help people understand what happens, as well as think about how people make sense of their lives after they leave.\r\n\r\nHe\u0027s hoping to start a PhD this year to get even deeper into the processes at work behind the cult and high control phenomenon on the rise. \r\n\r\nIn this episode, I interview the host of Cult Hackers Podcast, Stephen Mather, an organizational psychologist. He delves into the complex dynamics of cults, based on 267 episodes that he and his co-host Celine Mather, his daughter, conducted in what they are calling, \u0022season one\u0022 of Cult Hackers. 12\u002B episodes for a season is typical. 267 episodes is next level! Delve into the psychological dynamics behind these groups with insights from an organizational psychologist. \r\n\r\nStephen Mather spent a lot of his adult life, and in Cult Hackers, exploring the complexity of personal identity for new leavers, those who have exited a cult recently. The cult told members who you are and what your is or was. At this point in your life you need to form your own identity. That topic is deeply fascinating to me and essential for everyone. We\u0027ll get into the topic of behavior and identity guiding you to the authentic you.\r\n\r\nFrom chilling tales of cults in America and UK to the lesser-known groups emerging today in many countries, witness gripping accounts of the scariest cults in America and gain insight into church cults which we will reveal on the show.

They explore the meanings of apostasy and apostate, encouraging viewers to support the apostasy movement, join the growing community of ExJWs, and engage in compelling discussions about leaving Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses.\n\nThis episode serves as a call to action, urging the ExJW community to come together and support one another through an engaging education project. James and Scott emphasize the importance of backing channels that resonate with you before taking the plunge into creating your own. It\u0027s not just an interview \u2013 it\u0027s a rallying cry for collective empowerment and a reminder that everyone has a role to play in the journey towards understanding and liberation.\n\nGet involved, join the conversation, and be a part of the movement towards enlightenment and support within the ExJW community.

She arranges for Sissy to go on the road with \u0022Uncle Charlie,\u0022 a struggling, unstable magician headed out on a two-bit tour through Nevada. When the trip begins to deteriorate, so does Charlie.

Gain a deeper understanding of the film\u0027s inspiration, rooted in her experience as an abuse victim within the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses and a resulting dysfunctional home.

      "description": "Ryan DuVal, software engineer and old friend from Colorado, was the only person I asked to help produce Witness Underground. He flew up from Asheville North Carolina as our producer in Minneapolis and was the guiding light for multiple editing revisions.He brought a fresh perspective to the project that became essential in telling this deep nuanced story. This episode was recorded at the Auxbus podcast studio in Asheville, a start-up where he pioneered the audio software we recorded this on. He interviews me and my personal back story for the first time.\u00A0 (Auxbus was later bought by Libsyn and his software is their trademark audio editing software for their podcast\u00A0 distribution company). This was recorded on the heals of our production together, and after story-lock in our documentary post-production phase. He had a huge hand in the production influencing the story, and pulling out many valuable moments across our interviews. He also ran sound, wrote interview questions, and asked the interview questions, co-directing the storytelling.\u00A0 He also ran second camera for interviews, live performance music videos, and also some of the side stories that made it into the film, among many additional roles that we shared.\u00A0He was essential in the creation of this film.\u00A0 Enjoy this episode as he digs into my back story and the creation of this film, the XJW Coming Out series, and this podcast.Thanks Ryan!Watch now:http://WitnessUnderground.comWatch \u0026 Support:https://vimeo.com/ondemand/witnessundergroundhttps://Patreon.com/WitnessUndergroundhttps://YouTube.com/@WitnessUndergroundStore:https://witness-underground-cult-documentary-release.pledgebox.com/preorderJump into our Discordhttps://discord.gg/WUp9c95rsXReach out directly: XJWdoc@gmail.com-Scott",

We ended up shooting these additional short interviews in the backyard during the event for the XJW Coming Out series as a bonus episode.\n\nThree short interviews capture the diverse experiences of individuals who found the courage to question their upbringing in this \u0022Apocalyptic cult\u0022 and, in doing so, discovered the strength to forge their own paths.\n\nListen to three former Witnesses, Jesse America, Erica Rae, and James Zimmerman who got out. They all describe what life was like inside, pressures they experienced, why they left, and their new world views. \n\nThey dive into how they feel about this group looking back into their strange past.\n\nTopics discussed:\nCognitive dissonance, conflict caused by religion, inner feelings as a witness, cultural norms within the cult, mis-education, becoming open-minded, disconnection with organized religion, different way to believe in god, atheism, enjoying life now rather than waiting on a higher power, reconnecting with grandparents and other family that were disconnected from because of this religions intolerance of non-members. Being honest about reality, achieving contentment in life through community, life passions, bond through powerful friendships. Family strength, success through education, first in family history to get a degree, feeling of freedom and access to pursue passions, showing love without judgement towards others.\n\nUntethered from authoritarian control what did you do with your freedom?\n\nAre you happier now?\n\nWhat do you do now with your life?\n\nWhat advice can you give to active members of the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses?\n\n\u0022I\u0027m so much happier not being in this religion anymore. I want that for them.\u0022 Get out!",
