We ended up shooting these additional short interviews in the backyard during the event for the XJW Coming Out series as a bonus episode.\n\nThree short interviews capture the diverse experiences of individuals who found the courage to question their upbringing in this \u0022Apocalyptic cult\u0022 and, in doing so, discovered the strength to forge their own paths.\n\nListen to three former Witnesses, Jesse America, Erica Rae, and James Zimmerman who got out. They all describe what life was like inside, pressures they experienced, why they left, and their new world views. \n\nThey dive into how they feel about this group looking back into their strange past.\n\nTopics discussed:\nCognitive dissonance, conflict caused by religion, inner feelings as a witness, cultural norms within the cult, mis-education, becoming open-minded, disconnection with organized religion, different way to believe in god, atheism, enjoying life now rather than waiting on a higher power, reconnecting with grandparents and other family that were disconnected from because of this religions intolerance of non-members. Being honest about reality, achieving contentment in life through community, life passions, bond through powerful friendships. Family strength, success through education, first in family history to get a degree, feeling of freedom and access to pursue passions, showing love without judgement towards others.\n\nUntethered from authoritarian control what did you do with your freedom?\n\nAre you happier now?\n\nWhat do you do now with your life?\n\nWhat advice can you give to active members of the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses?\n\n\u0022I\u0027m so much happier not being in this religion anymore. I want that for them.\u0022 Get out!",
