      "description": "Sorry about the confusion. We uploaded the unedited file accidentally! Its fixed now! We have a special one for you tonight. 16 year old Nora Ashleigh was taken from her bedroom at 3AM and taken into the wastelands of Utah, where she was abused and subjected to all types of cruelty, and even torture. She endured this for 2 years until she finally escaped, and never looked back. But this wasn\u0027t a kidnapping or human trafficking incident. This was done at the request of her own parents. The people who took her were part of a goon squad, that worked for the Troubled Teen Industry. Isolation camps used to reeducate teens with issues. Issues in most cases that were the result of bad or lazy parenting. And, this is all 100% legal, and in many cases backed by the government. Many politicians and celebrities have dumped their teenage children off on these legalized gulags.  This is a multi million dollar industry, that still exists right now, and it isn\u0027t going away any time soon. Now 36 years old, Nora has taken the fight to them, and has become an activist against these organizations, whose practices would be shut down if it was a cult, or a far right militia camp or religious fundamentalist group.  Hundreds of deaths are on the hands of these groups, yet the victims get swept away, and not one of them has been held accountable. Part one is Nora\u0027s personal experience at the hands of these sadists. Part two is her escape, and all she and other survivors are doing to raise awareness.

      "description": "Another guest on the show, and another cult! We\u0027re covering Heaven\u0027s Gate, the Crazy Comet Cult. We discuss Marshall Applewhite and Bonnie Nettle\u0027s background, and how they took this from a crazy idea to a legit cult that had close to 50 people when it ended. It ended of course, when the majority of the cult all committed suicide to advance to \u0022The Next Level\u0022 which was a planet where they would live for eternity in an existence devoid of personality, feelings, and sex. These people bought in 100% to the teachings, believing that Applewhite and Nettles were the second coming of Jesus Christ, who had the tickets to leave Earth and go away in a spaceship to a better eternity, and that the only way to get there was to off yourself. Castrations not withstanding.  We\u0027re joined by Dr Paul Meckes of the Conscious Radio Network, and their podcast, The Weekly S\u00E9ance, on YouTube, Spotify, and all other platforms. He was awesome, and I\u0027m sure he will be back soon.  Follow us on Facebook Twitter   ",

An off shoot from the Mormon church that occurred when the Mormons banned multiple wives. Warren\u0027s father, Rulon Jeffs became the prophet, and Warren was the heir apparent. Rulon made him the principal of a FLDS school, where Warren began crafting his warped view of Mormonism, and indoctrinating the students. When Rulon died, Warren assumed the role of prophet, and not only amped up the multiple wives, he also brought in child brides, and began trafficking young girls to creepy bootlicker men in the cult. He also instituted a set of the most draconian laws imaginable. Women were nothing more than breeding stock.   Join us as we destroy this creep. Its a very rough story, but we get through it by brutally mocking Warren. Part 2 comes next Saturday.  Twitter Facebook Instagram Website ",

      "description": "We have a doozy for you today. A teenage sex cult, run by pedophile Mexican music producer, Sergio Andrade, and his biggest star, Gloria Trevi. Sergio was VERY good at developing female pop acts in Mexico. He had several platinum artists under his belt, and he was very well respected. Everything he touched turned to gold platinum. He was a gifted musician, and producer, and he had a knack for finding every client\u2019s individual strong spot, and he would bring this out in them. His record speaks for itself. But, if that\u2019s all he did, he wouldn\u2019t be featured on CKCB. He had a taste for underage girls, and married one of his acts. He was also an abusive tyrant prick. But once he discovered Gloria Trevi, and she became Mexico\u2019s top selling pop act of all time, he used his resume to entice many more young girls into his clutches, under the promise that he would \u201Cmake them a star!\u201D Before too long, he had a harem of girls that he was physically and sexually abusing, and he became the target of an international manhunt. One of his \u2018clients\u2019 who got the hell away from him was instrumental in bringing him down. Her courage is very admirable. Join us as we tell this riveting and unbelievable story.",

This is a relatively unknown case as well.\u00A0 The cult has most of the boxes checked to identify a religious cult. But, it has a twist. The cult leader is a woman. She unleashed hell on her followers, who believed that she was literally God. Its a brutal story, and this bitch got what she deserved in the end. So, buckle up! Its a bad one.

It was the biggest story in that part of the world for a very long time, as new wrinkles came to light. It has child abuse, obscure cults, cannibalism, and a girl who was sex trafficked, rescued, then vanished. But, things aren\u0027t always what they seem. Or, are they? This story begins when a video baby monitor being used by new parents picked up a stray signal from a similar device nearby. It showed a small naked boy, lying bound on the bare floor of a dark room with no windows. The new father called police, and the events that happened next over a few months are the most peculiar things you\u0027ve ever heard, with one of the craziest endings of any true crime story.\u00A0 Join us as we take you on this roller coaster ride of a case.

They believed among other things that God would heal anything wrong with you, and going to doctors was a sin.\u00A0 The church had a very high body count of people dying of preventable ailments. And, if you died, it was because your faith wasn\u0027t strong enough, and you had unconfessed sin. They also believed that only the people in their church were going to heaven.
