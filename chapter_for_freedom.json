      "description": "The story of my (Keturah Brumfield) departure from the religion of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses. The simple truth without diving in to the specifics of my research. \nThis video is tailored to my family and friends who I did not have an opportunity to speak with before I left. They now shun me because of my choice to disassociate myself from Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses. \nAt the time it was all too painful to bear and I needed to step away quickly with my family to help us find sanity and meaning beyond the skepticism and loss.",
