      "description": "We\u2019ve all got that friend or cousin who steadily hawks some overpriced miracle drink, leggings, or shampoo on social media. They aren\u2019t just trying to sell you something, but would like to offer you the opportunity of a lifetime to achieve riches while working from home on your own terms. You\u2019ve probably been too afraid, or too loving, or too reasonable to confront them. Not us. This season on The Dream we go inside the world of multi-level marketing to expose this pyramid-shaped business model for what it is. Join us on this bizarre journey filled with snake oil salesmen, shifty millionaires, struggling single moms, and a few sweet grandmas.See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",
