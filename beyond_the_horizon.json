      "title": "Juror # 18 From The Lori Vallow Trial Recounts His Experience And Talks About His Upcoming Book (2/28/24)",
      "description": "Lori Vallow gained significant media attention due to her involvement in a complex and tragic case involving the disappearance of her two children, Tylee Ryan and Joshua \u0022JJ\u0022 Vallow. Lori Vallow was married multiple times and had a history of unusual beliefs, including her involvement with a religious group known as Preparing a People. The case unfolded in late 2019 when concerned family members reported Tylee and JJ missing. Lori and her fifth husband, Chad Daybell, became the focus of the investigation after they were found to have misled authorities and exhibited suspicious behavior. The situation escalated when investigators discovered the bodies of Tylee and JJ buried on Chad Daybell\u0027s property in Idaho in June 2020. Lori Vallow was subsequently arrested and faced multiple charges, including conspiracy to commit murder and various counts of desertion and nonsupport of dependent children. Her husband, Chad Daybell, also faced charges related to the concealment of evidence and the children\u0027s deaths. The case drew widespread attention due to its intricate details, including allegations of cult-like beliefs, doomsday prophecies, and suspicious deaths of individuals associated with Lori and Chad, namely Lori\u0027s children. Throughout the legal proceedings, Lori Vallow\u0027s defense maintained her innocence, claiming mental health issues and coercion from Chad Daybell. However, as the investigation progressed, evidence mounted against both of them, leading to their eventual indictments and court appearances. After a blisterning presentation by the prosecution in Idaho, and a weak wristed attempt at a defense by Vallow, she was found guilty. In this episode, we hear from Juror # 18 who discusses what he went through while sitting on the jury and his plans to write a book after the conclusion of the Chad Daybell trial which is slated to get started in April of this year.
