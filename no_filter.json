      "description": "[Part 1 of 2] Bethany Joy Lenz has been in two cults. The first is the cult-classic TV series, One Tree Hill, where she played the role of Haley for ten years, alongside cast members Sophie Bush and Chad Michael Murray. Yet, what few people knew is that the entire time she was on the iconic show, she was in another kind of cult - the dangerous, isolating, manipulative kind. In this Australian exclusive, she shares her story with Mia Freedman and explains how she found herself in a cult to begin with, what it cost her - literally and figuratively - and what finally helped her find the courage to leave. Bethany Joy Lenz has written an incredible memoir about her experience, Dinner For Vampires - you can find it here . You can hear part two of Mia\u0027s conversation here.
