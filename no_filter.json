      "description": "You can hear the second half of Mia\u0027s conversation with Tia here. Subscribe to Mamamia Tia Levings was raised within the same strict Christian fundamentalist ideology as the infamous Duggar family from 19 Kids And Counting. By the time she was 19 years old, Tia found herself in an abusive marriage where the violence was sanctioned by the church. In this must-listen episode of No Filter, Tia tells Mia Freedman about the ways she was groomed to be a Trad Wife, and the moment she knew she had to run for her life. This is a story of indoctrination and survival, of reinvention and strength\u2026but it is also about the thousands of other women who haven\u2019t escaped the Trad Wife movement, and the new ones who are joining every day.
