I was able to speak with former member and kingdom kid Marissa to discuss her life growing up in the church, all the good bad and ugly as well as what led her to needing to exit the church in college. I do need to give a trigger warning for this episode as she discuss instances of self harm. We talked about growing up in this system, the pressure put on people, and the big topic we discussed is the lack of support for mental health in the church and how that lead her and people like her to grow up with little or no coping mechanisms for the struggles of life. If you are a member, were a member, or know someone who was a member of the ICOC or the ICC and would like to share your story of your life in and out of the church and help us maybe get closer to answering the question \u0022we were in a cult?\u0022, and maybe find some healing please contact me via email at clemenzwithaz@gmail.com or you can DM via Instagram at the \u0022Clemenz With a \u0022Z\u0022 podcast\u0022 Instagram page.

I was able to sit with former guest on the show Alex who was also a member of the ICOC. Our conversation centered mostly on what it was like as a \u0022kingdom kid\u0022 in the church and how much our view of reality and life was through the lens of the church and it\u0027s teaching. Some of the big topics were the feeling of guilt after baptism and continually trying to earn it, and how as you grew up in the church you learn little by little that you cannot trust yourself. I know that I can relate to that a lot. I am grateful to have had this conversation and you all should check this out!

We touched on many topics in this 2 and 1/2 hour conversation. We talked about her family life, the love for a god that she had and why she felt the need to join not just the ICOC but a church in general. She discussed the workload that was put on her in college by the church, what it was like when she became a campus leader and no matter what she did she always felt at the bottom of ladder. She also was able to discuss what led her to help and serve with the charity organization \u0022Hope Worldwide\u0022 abroad in Cambodia.

This episode is a big one for me and its because it is my first international episode. I was able to speak with former member of the International Churches of Christ Kesia who was a part of our church in Denmark. Kesia shared her story of growing up in the church and how even though she was a whole ocean away from us here in the stated the church was still the same. I am grateful for her sharing her story with me, to connect you all with more members who are feeling like we are, and to be able to get a more global perspective of the church. She even brought up \u0022The Great Pruning\u0022 which was something that I had forgotten about. I hope you all continue to find healing through these stories and are able to feel a little less alone and maybe even a little less crazy.
