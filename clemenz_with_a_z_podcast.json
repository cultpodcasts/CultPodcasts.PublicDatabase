I was able to speak with former member of the International Churches of Christ Kesia who was a part of our church in Denmark. Kesia shared her story of growing up in the church and how even though she was a whole ocean away from us here in the stated the church was still the same. I am grateful for her sharing her story with me, to connect you all with more members who are feeling like we are, and to be able to get a more global perspective of the church. She even brought up \u0022The Great Pruning\u0022 which was something that I had forgotten about. I hope you all continue to find healing through these stories and are able to feel a little less alone and maybe even a little less crazy.
