      "title": "Are Religious Cults Good Or Evil? Ireland 1996",
      "description": "Do religious cults ruin people\u2019s lives or change them for the better?\n\nDissatisfaction with the main Christian churches can provide cults - or new religious movements, with opportunities to attract new recruits.\n\nSome people believe cults are evil and sinister groups who brainwash people and ruin lives. Others who have joined cults say their lives have changed for the better.\n\nPeople shopping in Dublin\u2019s Ilac Centre give their opinions on whether there is any harm to religious cults. Some people interviewed believe cults are very dangerous, associating them with satanic rituals, witchcraft and black magic.\n\nOne woman admits she does not know much about cults but fears,\n\nThey brainwash everybody and take their money.\n\nAnother woman thinks cults are prey on intelligent, successful people who need to fill a void in their lives,\n\nI think people should be very wary.\n\nA man who says he is a Catholic has a relaxed attitude to what people chose to believe,\n\nI think everybody is entitled to whatever religion they would like to adopt.\n\nHowever an elderly woman is entirely dismissive of cults,\n\nCatholics don\u2019t go in for them things you know.\n\n\u2018Gerry Ryan Tonight\u2019 (GRT) is an Irish chat show hosted by Gerry Ryan that aired live for three series on Network 2 between 1995 and 1997.

      "description": "The growing popularity of cults has led to the setting up of a Cult Awareness Centre to provide information to potential followers.\n\nA new organisation has been established to provide information on religious cults. The Cult Awareness Centre was set up at the Irish Church Missions premises on Bachelors Walk, Dublin, in response to the increasing number of cults and sects targeting Ireland in recent years.\n\nAmong the supporters of the new group are former Moonies, Mormons, and Jehovah Witnesses.\n\nNoel Deane, Secretary at the Centre and former member of the Unification Church explains the purpose of the centre.\n\nWe hope to be able to provide proper information regarding the cults and false religions that are here in Ireland.\n\nRev. William Bridcut, Church of Ireland Superintendent of Irish Church Missions, talks about the increasing popularity of cults and the rise in problems associated with them. .\n\nWhen somebody comes along and says we have the truth and we alone are right, there\u2019s a certain attraction in that.\n\nAn RT\u00C9 News report broadcast on 3 May 1990.

It was founded in 1974 by Englishwoman Jenny James, who features in this report along with other Atlantis members living in the commune\u2019s house in Burtonport.\n\nThe group talk about the benefits of living an honest way of life. However, locals such as Hugh Boyle do not agree and says he would prefer to see them leave Burtonport and complains about having to listen to their \u201Chorrible screaming\u201D in the middle of the night.\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any room for them in Burtonport. They\u2019re a nuisance.\n\nAfter leaving Burtonport, the Atlantis Commune lived on the nearby island of Inishfree for several years before relocating to Colombia in South America.\n\nAn RT\u00C9 News reports on 10 January 1980.

      "description": "There has been a growth in popularity of religious groups like The Children of God and Divine Light Mission (DLM) who are meeting the needs of some young people looking to find meaning in their lives.\n\nDundalk born Tom McGuinness who goes by the biblical name of Zibiah claims to have found new meaning to his life as a member of the religious group \u2018The Children of God\u2019. Tom, along with other members of the group, are spreading the word of \u2018The Children of God\u2019 at St Stephen\u2019s Green in Dublin.\n\nThe Children of God is \n\u0022A religious sect which originated in California in 1968 and which has since spread throughout Europe.\u0022\n\nThe sect appeals mainly to young people who find themselves at odds with society. Each member is a missionary who believes that their work is to spread the word of God and to inform people that God loves them. Their message is The Bible, Jesus and joy largely through song and dance.\n\nAnother religious group seeking new devotees is the Divine Light Mission (DLM) which operates from the Dandelion Market in Dublin. Dubliner Joseph Burn was among the first to join the Divine Light Mission. The group was founded in 1960 by Guru Hans Ji Maharaj in northern India. Their message of inner peace is achieved through meditation.\n\n(Guru Maharaj) has come onto this world to show man how to experience his true identity.\n\nOne member of the DLM first heard about it while living in London and knew she had found what she had been looking for. Another member says that Guru Maharaj has shown him how to experience his soul.\n\nAt a house in Santry, the Mahatma who is second in line to the Guru, teaches lessons in Satsang meditation and preaches the message of DLM. Dublin housewife Mrs O\u2019Reilly is one of the many converts who has been convinced by his message.\n\nI have complete peace of mind. I have an absolute understanding of my own religion. As a Catholic, I can go to mass now and understand what the gospels are about, and for the first time I can fully realise the presence of God.\n\nMrs O\u2019Reilly says that DLM is not a religion but rather something to help you to understand your own religion.\n\nBoth The Children of God and Divine Light Mission forbid both alcohol and tobacco use amongst their followers.\n\nNo need for such drugs, they say, if you receive Jesus into your heart.\n\nThis episode of \u2018Tangents\u2019 was broadcast on 17 October 1972.",
