I\u2019ve been interested in true crime for the longest time now, what started with me watching true crime on TV with my Nan from a young age eventually turned into studying for a degree in Law \u0026 Criminology.\n\nWhen I first watched Bailey Sarian\u2019s series I was completely hooked, I loved how she had combined two of the things I\u2019m most passionate about and delivered it so well. She totally inspired me to take the leap and do the same thing on my channel, so all credit for the idea goes 100% to her.\n\nI\u2019m from the UK and will be covering cases from both the UK and internationally, let me know if there are any cases that you\u2019d like to see from me! More cases will be coming soon so please subscribe if you enjoyed this video!\n\n#daniellekirsty",
