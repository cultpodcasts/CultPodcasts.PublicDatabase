      "description": "John Andrew Collins grew up in the royal family of the William Branham Message movement. His grandfather was the senior pastor at Branham\u0027s Tabernacle. John began to have doubts when he was 37 and started research that has continued for more than a decade. He is a prolific author who has revealed the intimate connection between some Pentecostalists - including Branham - with the Ku Klux Klan from its re-founding in 1915. He found links between Pentecostal Christianity and the Kardashian family; a Branham complex in Chile that smuggled Nazis into Argentina; the connection between Branham and Jim Jones who was responsible for the Jonestown killings; and even a connection to David \u0027Moses\u0027 Berg founder of the despicable child-molesting Children of God. A fascinating tour through one of the most influential groups in today\u0027s politicized religious right.

Manson was passionately interested in Scientology while in prison. At least three other Family members were involved in Scientology. Popular works about Manson fail to understand that Scientology is an elaborate system of control techniques rather than simply a set of beliefs or rituals.

Her own positive experience with a neo-tantra group helped her to understand the devastations caused by three very different cults: Centrepoint and Gloriavale in Aotearoa, New Zealand, and Agama Yoga in Thailand. Centrepoint was a free-love cult whose leaders were eventually imprisoned for sexual abuse and child sexual abuse. Gloriavale is a contemporary pseudo-Christian cult with bizarre sexual mores. Agama Yoga has been called the \u0027rape cult\u0027 and belongs to the neo-tantra movement - which promotes the notion of bliss or even enlightenment through sex. Anke gives readings from her well-researched and shocking book. A must-read that will become a classic.

      "description": "Chris Shelton has a master\u0027s degree in the psychology of coercive control. He was born into Scientology and has made a study of its use of mind control techniques. Jon explains his own extensive research into the real foundations of hypnotic susceptibility. Hypnosis is not something done to us but an aspect of our everyday processing of the world. Understanding this makes us much less vulnerable to advertising, spin doctoring, fake news and recruitment into authoritarian groups and relationships.

      "description": "Harry Palmer transformed his Scientology Franchise into Avatar in the 1980s. Despite staff allegations of misconduct, he was able to create a worldwide movement with more members than the International Association of Scientologists. Ariela Sarai graduated from Columbia University in philosophy and religion and then spent six months working with Mother Theresa\u0027s outreach program before studying Tibetan Buddhism in the Dalai Lama\u0027s community. Returning to the US, she received a Master\u0027s in Social Work and was a practicing psychotherapist when therapist friends recruited her into Avatar; she was at the top of the organization by the time she left - after 21 years. Jon discusses the training methods - which borrow extensively from Scientology - the abuse within the group, and her departure and recovery from it. One of the most interesting chats on the channel!  Notes from Ariela:  -The Avatar courses were held in conference rooms in hotels with 200-4000 people from 50 countries attending. When we didn\u0027t have a student, we paid an internship fee of $650 plus hotel and airfare to teach the course. I was in the top inner circle, having daily contact with Harry Palmer\u0027s wife Avra Honey-Smith. I ran international teams, helping them recruit students and making sure they all had good results using the tools. I was on a course for 14-17 days per month.  -I am now a therapist with a full private practice, and I also work as a leadership coach at a Venture Capital firm. I am dedicated to helping people understand the tactics of manipulation and how to protect themselves and heal from this type of abuse. Although I don\u0027t actively seek to get people out of Avatar, I have helped many Avatars who reached out to me and needed help leaving and recovering.  -I am writing a memoir with my partner Mark to share our inner journey of this experience. I am also starting a Newsletter here.

His mother joined when he was four and he left school at 12 to study. He was a Sea Org member for a decade before he withdrew and began to speak out. A fascinating interview.

How can it be made worse to punish them? By being assigned to the Rehabilitation Project Force, where they are stripped of their rank, forced to sleep in \u201Cpigs\u2019 berthing\u201D, assigned to the meanest of manual labor, fed on the table scraps of the \u201Cregular\u201D Sea Org, made to wear black, not allowed to speak unless spoken to, and made to run rather than walk everywhere. In addition, they are subjected to hours of auditing to find out the \u201Ccrimes\u201D that they must have committed to have been such a \u201Cdegraded being.\u201D \u00A0 TR8 - Training Routine eight involves understanding how to place \u0022Intention\u0022 in any object, or, in the case of the routine, an ashtray.

      "description": "A review of the current court case in Los Angeles Criminal Courts where Danny Masterson is being tried for sexual assault. \u00A0\u00A0These are the TOP 5 points covered in this video: \u00A0\u00A0 1. Three women came forward to report the same incident to the Los Angeles Police Department: actor Danny Masterson had allegedly offered them a drink which made them semi-incapacitated, and then coerced them into physical relations.\u00A0 2. When one of these women reported the incident to a Scientology ethics officer she was told \u201CThere is no such thing as r*pe\u201D when you are in an intimate relationship. Another Ethics Officer told one of the women that she needed to supply physical intimacy to Danny on demand in EXCHANGE for living rent-free and having her meals paid for.\u00A0 3. Lisa Marie Presley, who was friendly with one of the women, was asked by Scientology staff to persuade her to NOT go to LAPD to report the assault. Lisa has subsequently apologized to the woman for doing this.\u00A0 4. Scientology (or any other cult) is ALWAYS the 3rd party, ever present in any intimate relationship and in Scn, anything voiced in counselling is carefully kept for blackmail, publication and control in the future.\u00A0 5. Jane Doe 4 was the fourth witness to Masterson\u2019s \u201Csignature\u201D of drugging before sexual assault. She had no \u201Cfish to fry\u201D \u2013 she wants no money from this case, only justice. \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Jon and Karen discuss details directly from court records. Journalist Tony Ortega has been faithfully transcribing the daily court prosecution and defense arguments at https://tonyortega.org for those who want to learn more. \u00A0\u00A0Note that Danny Masterson was in the Scientology for 40 years - this is an organization that takes \u201Cpride\u201D in their HIGH ETHICS and HIGH technology.",

Traditionalism is the simplistic creation of a golden age to support ideas of tribalism and racial purity. It has taken hold of populist movements and generated a new and ill-informed rightist upsurge. In the US, it is represented by Steve Bannon - who put Trump in the White House and was his first Chief of Staff; in Russia, by Alexander Dugin who preaches the re-unification of the Russian empire; and in Brazil by Olavo de Carvalho - Bolsanaro\u0027s guru. These pundits follow the teachings of Mussolini\u0027s advisor Julius Evola. They claim spiritual insight, but are ignorant of the subtle and complex ideas of true mysticism, instead grabbing beliefs in human decline - the End Days or Kali Yuga - as if they were prophetic truth, rather than bronze age anxieties. Mark and Jon show how traditions are often inventions to create tribalist separation between people. They offer some solutions to move us towards a pro-social, pro-human democracy that is neither left nor right wing.",

Conditions for the \u0022elite\u0022 Sea Org under Hubbard\u0027s direct control were deplorable.

Mike was tasked with \u0022baby-watching\u0022 the first victim of the Introspection Rundown (on which Lisa McPherson later died), which Hubbard claimed would cure insanity. Mike was also the only Scientologist left on the island of \u00A0Madeira after the notorious \u0022rock festival\u0022, where locals hurled bricks \u00A0and cobblestones at the Apollo, and was lucky to escape with his life. links: ex-Scientology kids: http://exscientologykids.com the Aftermath Foundation: http://theaftermathfoundation.org",

Why did Hubbard register the Church of \u00A0Scientology secretly, and why did he register the Church of American \u00A0Science (the \u201Cmother church\u201D) and the Church of Spiritual Engineering? \u00A0Are the Scientology upper levels an aspect of ritual magic?\u00A0 You can rent the complete set of lectures from this important conference \u00A0on vimeo, here: https://vimeo.com/ondemand/gettingclear",

In the 80s and \u00A090s there were only a handful of persistent critics, but now thousands \u00A0are speaking out, so Scientology no longer has the resources to harass \u00A0any but its most vocal critics.
