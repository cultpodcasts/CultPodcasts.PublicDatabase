We lived collectively both physically and financially. Each member is considered family and we have to treat everyone as such.

      "description": "Welcome to HOW TO LEAVE A CULT. This is our fabulous intro! I want to share why I am creating this podcast as well as what you can expect from future episodes. I want to create a community where people who have been abused by cults or religious groups can learn and heal. I will be sharing my very personal story of being raised in a religious cult for nearly 30 years. I will also be sharing how I have healed and how you can too. You can move past the past. You deserve to not carry that kind of baggage anymore. My story will share manipulation, gaslighting, alcoholism, as well as a cult run charter school, massive lawsuits, cult experts, arranged marriage and so much more.
