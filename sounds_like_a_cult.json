      "description": "Father is back!!! No, not Father Algorithm, but *actual* Father. Indeed, Amanda\u0027s sweetie dad, Craig Montell, returns to the pod after his featurette on last year\u0027s cult of Military Wives episode, for an extra-special end-of-year, two-part deep dive into the cult that he survived and that inspired this entire show: Synanon. Craigo brings his dad charm and cult experience to break down exactly how this well-intentioned drug rehabilitation program spiraled into a full-on \u002770s compound complete with paranoia, hypocrisy, and some very strange hairstyling choices. This \u0022classic cult\u0022 discussion may not be typical SLAC fodder, but the story is actually more relevant than ever. Craig is here not just to divulge his shocking past, but also to scrutinize how Synanon\u2019s same rituals and methods of manipulation are alive and well in today\u0027s society, from our politics to our social media feeds. Cozy in for some culty parental wisdom, and stay tuned for Part 2 next week to hear the end of the tale! Subscribe to Sounds Like A Cult on YouTube !

      "description": "New Age love \u0026 wellness influencers turned baby NXIVM: That\u0027s kinda the best way we can succinctly describe this week\u2019s cult, Twin Flames Universe, one of the most chilling groups we\u2019ve discussed on the pod thus far. Several months ago, Twin Flames survivor Jessi Hersey, whom you might recognize from the \u201CEscaping Twin Flames\u201D doc on Netflix, slid into our DMs and made a very generous and compelling argument as to why Twin Flames needed airtime on Sounds Like A Cult. After all, it\u2019s important to represent the whole LYL, WYB, GTFO cult spectrum! This week, we\u0027re asking the fundamental questions: How did this niche online self-help \u201Ccommunity\u201D turn so destructive so fast, and how are its tenets low-key a threat to us all? Tune in to find out, and make sure to listen to the very end of the episode. We\u2019re making a highly exciting announcement about the next season of SLAC\u2026 let\u2019s just say there might be a couple new \u201Ccult leaders\u201D (ahem, co-hosts) in your future!
