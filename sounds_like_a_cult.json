      "description": "At long last, the man/myth/legend, Amanda\u0027s dad, Craig Montell, whose riveting stories of his childhood spent in the Synanon cult planted her fascination with all things \u0022cultish,\u0022 joins as this week\u0027s guest. In this *extremely wholesome* episode, Amanda and her pop analyze a quartet of listener-submitted stories, documenting four firsthand experiences with \u201Cculty\u201D groups (from military wives to Abercrombie \u0026 Fitch) comparing each one to the surreal mindfuckery and power dynamics Craig witnessed in Synanon. The episode mostly focuses on the \u201Ccult\u201D of military spouses... faaaaascinating how closely it resembles a bonafide \u002770s-era cult. But is it a Life Your Life, Watch Your Back, or GTFO?? Tune in to find out. Thanks so much to all who wrote in their culty tales!

      "description": "Why does it seem like certain \u0022life coaches\u0022 are exactly the kinda folks who shouldn\u0027t be giving life advice? The unregulated life coaching industry is perfectly set up to turn culty: It\u0027s rife with New Age quacks charging thousands to tell others how to live, but also... hiring a brainstorming partner to help you work through sh*t during times of uncertainty *does* sound beneficial? Tricky!! This week, Amanda and Isa are joined by comedian and host of the Self-Helpless podcast Kelsey Cook to unpack how much of a \u0022cult\u0022 the life coach space has really become.

Having launched a social media career in the mid-2000s (and still going strong), Swan doesn\u2019t post about beauty products and travel inspo but rather spiritual-meets-\u201Cscientific\u201D teachings on a wide range of topics from addiction to chakras to vaccines to suicide. Some of her most committed adherents follow her down to Costa Rica to experience her shady self-actualization techniques IRL. Swan is the subject of the new Hulu docuseries The Deep End, based on the fascinating 2018 podcast The Gateway, which was created and hosted by this week\u2019s guest, Jennings Brown, who\u2019s here to talk with Amanda and Isa about the fanatical \u201Ccult\u201D Swan has built online.

MLMs are at once the butt of countless jokes about pyramid schemes and brainwashed #girlbosses, and yet they maintain a profound hold on a certain slice of aspiring entrepreneurs, who\u2019ve been promised that some shadily structured \u201Conce-in-a-lifetime opportunity\u201D will guarantee them the American Dream (and more). MLMs are certainly scammy, but are they culty? And if so, what kind of \u201Ccult\u201D are they? In this episode, we attempt to find an answer...",
