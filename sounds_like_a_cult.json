      "description": "New Age love \u0026 wellness influencers turned baby NXIVM: That\u0027s kinda the best way we can succinctly describe this week\u2019s cult, Twin Flames Universe, one of the most chilling groups we\u2019ve discussed on the pod thus far. Several months ago, Twin Flames survivor Jessi Hersey, whom you might recognize from the \u201CEscaping Twin Flames\u201D doc on Netflix, slid into our DMs and made a very generous and compelling argument as to why Twin Flames needed airtime on Sounds Like A Cult. After all, it\u2019s important to represent the whole LYL, WYB, GTFO cult spectrum! This week, we\u0027re asking the fundamental questions: How did this niche online self-help \u201Ccommunity\u201D turn so destructive so fast, and how are its tenets low-key a threat to us all? Tune in to find out, and make sure to listen to the very end of the episode. We\u2019re making a highly exciting announcement about the next season of SLAC\u2026 let\u2019s just say there might be a couple new \u201Ccult leaders\u201D (ahem, co-hosts) in your future!
