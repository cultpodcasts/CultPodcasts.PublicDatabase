When the original, power hungry minister of the church, Jerry Irwin, died, his even worse daughter, Tiffanie, took over. Years of brainwashing, control and abuse would cause some members to defect, but the few who remained would suffer a horrible fate. And in the end, a 19-year-old would lose his life in a brutal, heartbreaking way.\n\nSources:\nhttps://people.com/crime/word-of-life-church-defendants-pastor-guilty-pleas/\nhttps://people.com/crime/inside-the-world-life-church-is-it-a-cult/\nhttps://people.com/crime/former-cult-members-discuss-leaving-the-word-of-life-church/\nhttps://people.com/crime/killer-cult-former-members-claim-upstate-new-york-church-is-deathly-cult/\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/23/nyregion/at-word-of-life-church-an-evolution-from-bible-study-group-to-secretive-sect.html\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/15/nyregion/lucas-leonard-beating-death-at-upstate-new-york-church.html\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/17/nyregion/congregants-were-abused-and-shamed-at-church-where-fatal-beating-occurred-ex-member-says.html\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/16/nyregion/brothers-beating-at-upstate-new-york-church.html\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/20/nyregion/brother-who-survived-beating-at-new-york-church-to-testify-against-relative.html?action=click\u0026module=RelatedCoverage\u0026pgtype=Article\u0026region=Footer\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/16/nyregion/brothers-beating-at-upstate-new-york-church.html?action=click\u0026module=RelatedCoverage\u0026pgtype=Article\u0026region=Footer\nhttps://www.syracuse.com/crime/2022/09/man-out-of-prison-after-seven-years-following-word-of-life-church-killing-beatings.htmlhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuV-xr6EgRI\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSlILgLcOxA\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDOaNLzrxw\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr5xg36x1PM\n\nChapters:\nIntro 0:00\nMurder By Choice 1:51 \nWtf happened? 4:03\nJerry Irwin 9:28\nThe Cult 16:30\nA New Prophet 21:57\nThe beginning of the end 36:09",

The group operated mostly out of suburban Connecticut and there was widespread abuse throughout the cult. Multiple deaths have been linked to Julius and The Work, with one in particular being confirmed to be a murder. Julius died in 1996, but The Work is still active today.\n\nSources:\nhttps://www.investigationdiscovery.com/crimefeed/id-shows/sinful-messiah-the-work-cult-multiple-wives-exploitive-labor-murderhttps://people.com/crime/brother-julius-schacknow-the-work-connecticut-cult-people-magazine-investigates/\nhttps://www.myrecordjournal.com/News/Lifestyle/Features/history-of-the-Brother-Julius-and-The-Work-cult-based-out-of-meriden.html#gallery-1\nhttps://people.com/crime/self-proclaimed-sinful-messiah-sexually-abused-dozens-while-leading-polygamist-doomsday-cult/\nhttps://nypost.com/2018/08/02/two-cult-members-busted-in-grisly-death-of-chief-apostle/\nhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt10667262/?ref_=ttep_ep4\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1795103620/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8\u0026psc=1\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRyppog0LdU\nhttps://www.ctinsider.com/news/article/Man-77-accused-of-killing-CT-cult-leader-dies-16791935.php\nhttps://blotterpresents.substack.com/p/its-an-all-cult-issue\nhttps://culteducation.com/group/938-gospel-assembly/7594-fifteenyears-in-destructive-gospel-assembly-churches.html\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrbBJs3pf28\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZXWwwcnypU\n\nChapters:\nIntro 0:00\nMyHeritage 2:03\nA Gruesome Discovery 5:22\nJulius 6:07\nSuspicious Deaths 17:20\nCult Life 23:49\nCult Murder 41:08",
