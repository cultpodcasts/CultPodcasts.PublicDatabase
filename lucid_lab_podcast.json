There was abstinence from all things, spiritual ascension, unwavering devotion, lots of camping, and suicide. And what made this cult stand out compared to some others of the time?

      "description": "It\u2019s our first cult story! Welcome to The Family! The Family, or The Great White Brotherhood, is a woman-led doomsday cult founded in the 1960s in beautiful Australia. It is the twisted story of Anne Hamilton-Bryne, who gained too much power way too fast and destroyed all the lives of those who followed her. Especially her precious children. She was the Messiah, and her children were to educate what was left of humanity after the apocalypse. She was selfish, vain, and evil. And her Aunties were not the type of Aunties you would want to raise your children. Listen in to hear all the sinister details. There is a reason some consider her to be one of the cruelest people to come from Australia. --- Please rate and subscribe on iTunes and anywhere else you listen to podcasts!!
