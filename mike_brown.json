      "description": "Early life as a young kid thrown into the life of a Sea Org Cadet.\n\nMirriam Francis and Christi Gordon, both raised in Scientology, continue their Cadet Org series exploring what it was like to grow up in Scientology\u0027s Sea Organization. They discuss the psychological and physical harm they and other children suffered under this system that saw them as future assets rather than individuals. The duo are joined by Mike Brown, another survivor of Scientology\u0027s child indoctrination and exploitation who shares his traumatic experience. The journey includes personal recollections and leaked internal documents from the Cadet Org. In part one of this expansive conversation, Mike, describes his beginnings in Scientology, his home life, and how he was human trafficked as a child along with his mother, Rosemary, into signing a billion-year contract, to what she believed was a church group. Mike eventually escaped Scientology, and found a new life, career, and family, but is now bravely coming forward to share his story and advocate for other Scientology victim-survivors, including his mother, whom he rescued years later, after discovering her suffering from long-term human rights violations, elder neglect, and financial exploitation, at the hands of her so-called church.\n\nPlease subscribe to Marriam and Christi\u0027s channel: @ChildrenOfScientology \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nMike can be contacted by email at alifetimeago101@gmail.com\n\nPlease consider subscribing to this channel, @MikeBrown101\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nMike Brown is a private citizen who was brought into the world of scientology at a young age and spent close to 2 decades being raised by and working for scientology until he escaped in 2003.
