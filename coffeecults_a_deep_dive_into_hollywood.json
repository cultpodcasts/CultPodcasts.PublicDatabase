      "title": "How Diddy Helped Make J Lo A Music Star \u0026 Bought Her Silence",
      "description": "Diddy \u0026 Jennifer Lopez were an item back in the late 1990\u0027s and early 2000\u0027s and during their relationship the both went through huge life altering moments. During their relationship Diddy helped J Lo break into the music scene and become a star. At the same time, Diddy \u0026 J Lo were involved in a sho*oting at Club New York just prior to New Years 1999. Both J Lo \u0026 Diddy were arrested \u0026 evidence \u0026 accusations stacked up, although surprisingly after a ling trial, Diddy walked away completely exonerated. This event went on to create headline after headline, \u0026 despite Combs was charged with serious crimes, J Lo remained loyal and by his side. J Lo has kept the details of that night a secret, \u0026 a lot of mystery remains around it still to this day, which is why we\u2019ll be taking a closer look at what really happened, because there is SO much more to the story of how Jennifer Lopez gained her enormous music career, her relationship with Combs \u0026 her career in present day. It seems as though after decades of rudeness, poor treatment of others \u0026 horrendous behaviour, J Lo\u0027s past, actions \u0026 behaviour has finally caught up to her.
