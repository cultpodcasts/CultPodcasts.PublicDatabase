      "description": "The Sunday School Dropouts are proving their dropout status today! We are talking about all things White Christian Nationalism, including the origins, impacts, and how to heal with Rev. Angela Denker. Angela is the author of \u201CRed State Christians\u201D and the forthcoming book \u201CDisciples of White Jesus\u201D where she writes about the growing phenomenon of White Christian Nationalism and its impact on a specific group of people: White men and boys. Throughout this conversation we begin to see how this extremist approach began, why it thrives and even how to navigate relationships with people in our lives who live according to those values. Andrew and Laura also discuss the term \u2018gaslighting\u2019 and explain what it truly means\u2013instead of how it\u2019s talked about on social media and in pop culture\u2013as a way to help people better organize and name what happened to them.

      "description": "Want to heal from religious trauma? Then you\u2019re listening to the right podcast! Today we are talking with licensed therapist, coach, and Somatic Experiencing practitioner, Jeremy Lehmann. Jeremy talks to us about what the nervous system is, it\u2019s roll in trauma, and why it\u2019s essential to the process of healing from trauma. We also get into a fascinating discussion regarding how the absence of safe and stable connection can also result in trauma through the topic of lack of sex education in high control religion. We\u2019ll also be bringing to you our first vocabulary lesson of the season, discussing the term \u2018trauma response\u2019. Do Andrew and Laura think that it\u2019s a term worth using or has social media co-opted yet another term to make it mean something entirely different? Tune in to hear their thoughts!

This week we\u2019ll begin our touchstone topic series with a discussion about what religious trauma is! Our touchstone topic series is one where we talk about some of the foundations of religious trauma, the nervous system, the difference between deconstruction and deconversion, and adverse religious experiences. And we\u2019re also bringing back some of your favorite segments! In this episode we have Flannelgraph Storytime where we have a fascinating discussion on the impact of James Dobson and the Strong Willed Child propaganda. And, we can\u2019t forget prayer requests!

      "description": "For those of you who don\u2019t know Josh Harris, he is a former pastor and poster-child of the purity culture movement with his (formerly) best selling book, I Kissed Dating Goodbye, which was published when he was 21\u2013which meant he was even younger when he wrote it\u2013like 19 years old!. The book and the pastors around him gave Josh a national platform where he was looked to as an authority and subsequently, someone whose teachings were incredibly harmful. In 2015, Josh left formal ministry and the United States and just a few years after that Josh and his then wife announced they were dissolving their marriage and Josh began publicly speaking about his faith deconstruction process. Josh has received both welcome and warning from people in post-religious spaces and though he does not consider himself a leader in faith deconstruction spaces, he desires to hold space and hear stories from people who are coming out of these environments\u2013many of whom were deeply harmed by the teachings he was taught, lived, and promoted. In Josh\u2019s words\u2026 \u201CI spent the first 40 years of my life promoting what I now see as narrow, controlling, fear-based religion. Today I\u2019m an advocate for the freedom to change, grow, and walk away from systems and beliefs that no longer fit. I want to see religious and non-religious communities healthier. Stepping outside of rigid religion, I\u2019ve found there\u2019s a lot of room for discovery. For hearing and telling new stories. For creating new things in business. And spotlighting people whose ideas can reshape the world.\u201D This podcast is brought to you by the Center for Trauma Resolution and Recovery: an online trauma coaching company whose practitioners are trauma informed and trauma trained to work with individuals, couples and families who have experienced high control religion, cults, and religious trauma.

      "description": "We are thrilled to have with us today Dr. Tina Schermer Seller who is an author, researcher, professor, and psychotherapist specializing in the impacts of purity culture, shame resilience, gender, and sexuality. In this episode, Dr. Tina shares her research and how she came to realize the psychological and physiological impact of purity culture and how that shaped the direction of her work with clients, students, and her writing. In the episode, Dr. Tina shares an incredible definition of sexual shame (see below) that can help us understand the felt sense experience of purity culture! But before we talk to Dr. Tina, we have a vocabulary lesson on what are porn and sex addictions really and why religion is so quick to diagnoses people with them, and we\u2019ll also be taking some prayer requests! This is an episode you won\u2019t want to miss! Dr. Tina\u2019s definition of sexual shame (taken from the dissertation of Noel Clarke): Sexual shame is a visceral feeling of humiliation and disgust toward one\u2019s own body and identity as a sexual being and a belief of being abnormal, inferior and unworthy. this feeling can be internalized but also manifests in interpersonal relationships having a negative impact on trust, communication, and physical and emotional intimacy. Sexual shame develops across the lifespan in interactions with interpersonal relationships, one\u2019s culture and society, and subsequent critical self-appraisal (a continuous feedback loop). There is also a fear and uncertainty related to one\u2019s power or right to make decisions, including safety decisions, related to sexual encounters, along with an internalized judgement toward one\u2019s own sexual desire.
