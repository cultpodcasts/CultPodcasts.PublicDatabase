      "description": "We\u2019re back with another episode from our purity culture mini-series! This week\u2019s guest is RC Curtwright (@deconstructing_exjw on Instagram) who grew up in the Jehovah\u2019s Witness organization and was a poster child of purity culture. In our conversation RC shares some of the long term impacts, mental health issues and shame that he and\u00A0 many other men experienced as a result of purity culture. Before we get into our conversation, Laura answers a listener question and shares a little bit about being a church leader and teaching adolescents about purity culture, thereby having a front row seat to the lived experiences of men and boys.
