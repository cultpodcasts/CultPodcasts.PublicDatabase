      "description": "In this emotionally charged episode, Tony hosts Taylor and Tami, a son and mother duo with a story that unfolds layers of family secrets, supernatural experiences, and a harrowing journey through darkness. Beginning with light-hearted exchanges about personal quirks and shared memories, the conversation quickly veers into the depths of their family\u0027s history, entangled with a religious cult known as \u0022The Truth.\u0022 As the narrative progresses, Taylor shares his move to Florida to pursue professional wrestling, only to return home to Albuquerque amidst his mother\u0027s divorce from a prominent politician, unraveling a series of events that would forever alter their lives.\n\nThe story takes a darker turn as Tami and Taylor get into their family\u0027s entanglement with the cult, culminating in a chilling confrontation with what they describe as pure demonic evil. Taylor\u0027s aspirations and his mother\u0027s escape from the cult\u0027s grasp serve as a backdrop to a broader discussion on faith, redemption, and the fight against an unseen malevolence that threatens to consume their lives. Through their account, they explore themes of betrayal, the quest for identity, and the power of resilience in the face of unimaginable horror. This episode is a gripping tale of survival, a testament to the strength of the human spirit, and a profound reflection on the nature of evil and the possibility of hope in darkness.\n\nJoin this channel to get exclusive content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/TheConfessionalsPodcast/join\n\nThe Confessionals Members App:\nApple Store: https://apple.co/3UxhPrh\nGoogle Play: https://bit.ly/43mk8kZ\n\nBecome a member for AD FREE listening and EXTRA shows: theconfessionalspodcast.com/join\n\nWatch The Shape of Shadows: https://www.merkel.media/stream-now\nWatch Expedition Dogman: https://bit.ly/3CE6Kg0\n\nAFFILIATES\nPrepare with Valley Food Storage: https://alnk.to/2uG55AO\nGet your Nephilim Blaster 2000: https://alnk.to/9mnHak1\nBluecosmo Satellite phones: https://alnk.to/e769Eip\nSee Bigfoot with Sionyx night vision: https://alnk.to/bEhxr3F\nEmergency medical with My Medic: https://alnk.to/dpr6QM4\nBlack Beard Fire Starters: https://alnk.to/4BFcIbe\nEcoFlow Power Generators: https://alnk.to/flvpAQw\nGoDark Faraday Bags: https://alnk.to/5jke3rk\nEMP Shield: empshield.com Coupon Code: \u0022tony\u0022 for $50 off every item you purchase!\n\nSPONSORS\nFACTOR MEALS: factormeals.com/confessionals50\nSIMPLISAFE TODAY: simplisafe.com/confessionals\nHello Fresh: hellofresh.com/confessionalsfree Promo Code: \u0022confessionalsfree\u0022 for FREE BREAKFAST FOR LIFE!!!\n\nCONNECT WITH US\nWebsite: www.theconfessionalspodcast.com\nEmail: contact@theconfessionalspodcast.com\nSubscribe to the Newsletter: https://www.theconfessionalspodcast.com/the-newsletter\n\nMAILING ADDRESS:\nMerkel Media\n257 N.
