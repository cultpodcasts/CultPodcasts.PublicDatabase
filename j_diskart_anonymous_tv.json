      "title": "The End of Apollo Quiboloy Kingdom of Jesus Christ CULT",
      "description": "In the following video, we will dissect the story of Apollo Quiboloy. Apollo Quiboloy is a pastor of a church that is by the name of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ. It is a modern-day cult that believes in essentially one-ness Pentecostalism. \n\nA monotheistic cult with a pastor who claims to be the appointed son of God. Not only does he think he is the appointed son of God, but he believes he has a deity and should be worshipped. \n\nAnd you know, no one here to blame him for what he thinks is true. However, his lifestyle is one thing to question. It\u0027s one thing to say, you know, that you are the Christ of the modern day. But it\u0027s another thing to say that you are the Christ of the modern day, but you also engage in sex trafficking, money laundering, immigration fraud, and marriage fraud, and you are somehow on the FBI\u0027s most wanted list. It\u0027s tough to draw the line where you can convince us that you are the son of God. Still, as we say in America, everybody is innocent until proven guilty, even though they are treated like they are guilty until proven innocent. \n\nHe flew by his whole life, lying and stealing from the poorest people in the world. He was a snake at the beginning and middle of his life and is still a snake today. Having lived a lavish life of luxury for the past 30 years, it\u0027s only happened that four years ago, something finally caught on the federal government\u0027s radar. He must have been slick for so long, but he was detained in Hawaii after being discovered with over 350,000 dollars in undeclared cash inside a briefcase and weapons. He hasn\u0027t been near the United States since he\u0027s wanted now by the Federal Bureau of Investigations. \n\nWhile he\u0027s been in hiding for quite some time, it has only been a few months since the Philippines started questioning if they should begin the investigation. And they finally did the right thing for once, and they investigated. It was definitely guilty of crimes against women and crimes against children. And there are several more crimes that he has yet to be charged for. This video is not an overall of what\u0027s happening, but it will show you what is happening to him. At the end of the video, there\u0027s a sneak peek at what happened to Apollo Quiboloy and what made him turn this way, a story that has never been told. \n\nThank you to @Rappler for providing 95% of this content.

      "title": "The Appointed Son of God: Apollo Quiboloy",
      "description": "The appointed son of god, apollo quiboloy is a rather interesting character. Especially in our time. He had a prophecy years ago and said that the world would end on a certain day. That day came and when the \u0022end\u0022 did not come, he announced that he was Christ on Earth. Making him, a self-proclaimed appointed son of God. All due to his influence and power over the poor, he takes advantage of their way of life and keeps them dependent on the church. He is a rockstar. He has private jets. Has his own airport. Lives a completely different life from what we think Jesus would be living. He calls his home. or His compound, \u0022The New Jerusalem.\u0022 The Kingdom of Jesus Christ is his church. He lies and says that Jesus is still who Jesus is. But this is far from the truth. He was influenced as a child who grew up Catholic. He learned Seventh Day Adventism. He learned Jehovas Witness. It was not until he was convinced that Jesus was the Father and he believed they were the same person. This is called Oneness Pentecostal. The belief that the Holy Trinity is just a conversion of entities with really one God in all essences. The religion he created is a cult of Christianity and is estimated to have around 1 million members across the globe. \n\n\nIn case I\u0027m not here and you need to ask me something, I made this channel for you. I hope to have the answer or insight you\u0027re looking for. I tried my best to cover as much as I could during my time there. Stay safe, do the right thing, apologize but never say sorry, forgive even if you won\u0027t forget, fall in love even if you know you\u0027ll regret it. But most important, discover your abstract then tell your truth and tell your story. Because someone is going to need to ask you something when you\u0027re gone, that\u0027s why I created this vlog, \u0022When I\u0027m Gone.\u0022 I really mean it when I say that this guy is the biggest scam artist in the world. There are so many in the world but this guy is definitely number one. \n\nSon of God Video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUpp_UrnjFc\n\nHip Hop Rap Instrumental (Crying Over You) by Chris Morrow 4 https://soundcloud.com/chris-morrow-3\nCreative Commons - Attribution 3.0 Unported- CC BY 3.0 \nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/b...\n\nChannel Schedule:\nMonday - Personal/Current Events\nTuesday - Food Challenges \nWednesday - Q/A \nThursday - Spontaneous \nFriday - Answering Reddit Questions \nSaturday - Story Time \nSunday - Spontaneous \nUploads are at 6pm PST.
