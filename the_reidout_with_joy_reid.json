      "description": "Tonight on The ReidOut, Joy Reid covers the global condemnation that erupted following an Israeli airstrike that tragically claimed the lives of seven humanitarian aid workers associated with Chef Jose Andres\u0027 World Central Kitchen, labeling the strike as \u0022unforgivable.\u0022 Furthermore, we delve into the concerning phenomenon of the Trump cult, where his followers seemingly disregard his alleged crimes and elevate him to a messianic figure at his rallies. Exploring the influence of a renowned minister from the 1950s and \u002760s on Trump\u0027s tactics will shed light on this worrisome trend. Additionally, marking 103 years since the Tulsa Race Massacre, two centenarian survivors persist in their quest for justice, coinciding with a pivotal court hearing today, highlighting the enduring struggle for accountability and reconciliation. All this and more in this edition of The ReidOut on MSNBC.",
