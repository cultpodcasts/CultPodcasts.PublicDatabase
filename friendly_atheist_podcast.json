      "description": "In Louis Theroux\u0027s new film, My Scientology Movie, the Church of Scientology doesn\u0027t give him access to the key leaders or buildings themselves...

Theroux has worked with Michael Moore, and his projects have often focused on interesting subcultures -- everything from the KKK to Westboro Baptist Church.
