They found out about Scientology and joined in 1968.   Robbie and his band were there with Yvonne at the very beginnings of Celebrity Centre  in Los Angeles and eventually they joined the Sea Organization while continuing to tour and perform as a rock band.

      "description": "Introductory video about the channel with Mark Fisher and Janis Gillham Grady.  Scientology and Sea Organization veterans, who will tell you stories you have never heard before.  Janis worked directly with L. Ron Hubbard, Scientology Founder, 6 hours a day, 7 days a week for many years as one of his Original Messengers.  Mark joined the Sea Organization in the mid 70s and eventually work directly for David Miscavige for over 6 years, in charge of Miscavige\u0027s office at the secret International Base in Gilman Hot Springs, California.  Janis and Mark left Scientology in 1990, after the abuses that occurred at the hands of Miscavige.   After leaving, they were both subject to Scientology\u0027s Fair Game tactics and harassment for over 20 years. Janis and Mark had unprecedented access to the daily workings and history of Scientology, L. Ron Hubbard, David Miscavige and the Sea Organization.  This Channel will reveal those stories, some for the first time.\n\nIf you would like to make a donation to this channel you can donate with Venmo.  Our Venmo address is @Mark-Fisher-176",
