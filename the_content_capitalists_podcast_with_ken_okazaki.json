      "description": "This episode is not about content creation, making money, or even really about entrepreneurship. It\u2019s about me and past, born and raised in a cult. \n\nIf you\u2019re here for stories, tips and tricks on content marketing, then I\u2019ll save you the time and tell you to skip.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in my past, where I came from, and why I do a lot of what I do, then go ahead and listen to the most raw uncut podcast I\u2019ve recorded to date. \n\nWhat it took was my sister, June, to ask me the questions nobody else could. \n\nWhat the fuck was our childhood about?\n\nShe\u2019s a professional Japanese-English interpreter, and probably the best there is, working with world leaders and presidents at the UN and other global business leaders. But we have a shared history being raised in a cult that affected everything about us today.\n\nThe impact on our lives is huge and it takes a level of incredible resilience for anyone to turn something like that around and build a life, a family, and a successful career despite having a dark past.\n\nClick play to enter the rabbit hole.\n\nFollow June Kato-Rider at:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/junie.balloonie/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/junekatorider/\n\n\nFollow Ken Okazaki at: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/kenokazaki/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/KenOkazaki\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-content-capitalists-with-ken-okazaki/id1634328251\nhttps://open.spotify.com/show/09IzKghscecbI7jPDVBJTw\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 Welcome to the Content Capitalists Podcast\n00:16 Introducing June Kato-Rider\n01:19 Growing Up in a Religious Cult\n03:02 June Kato\u0027s Career as a Celebrity Interpreter\n06:08 Challenges of Simultaneous Interpretation\n09:03 Cultural and Linguistic Differences in Interpretation\n12:37 Impact of Cult Upbringing on Professional Life\n17:03 Journey to Personal Growth and Authenticity\n20:01 Mental Health and Therapy for Cult Survivors\n24:25 The Value of Honesty in Professional Relationships\n27:06 Potential Podcast Series on Cult Experiences\n33:06 Overcoming the Challenges of Public Speaking\n37:45 Embracing Vulnerability in Personal and Professional Life\n42:12 The Role of Family Support in Career Success\n46:38 Future Plans\n\n#cultsurvivor #familyinterview #contentcapitalist #personaljourney #authenticity #mentalhealth #therapystories #interpretinglife #cultawareness #personalstories #japaneseculture #languagebarrier #overcomingadversity #siblingtalk #emotionalgrowth #lifeexperiences #publicspeaking #influencertalk #uniqueupbringing #careerjourney #contentcapitalists #JuneKato #KenOkazaki",
