      "title": "Tahiry \u0026 The Controlling Spiritual Abuser - Narcissist Abuse, Domestic Violence",
      "description": "Tahiry was in a long-distance relationship with a spiritual leader, but it wasn\u0027t until they moved in with each other that Tahiry started learning about his controlling and abusive behavior. As Tahiry did her best to cope with the abuse, she uncovered that her partner was also a sexual predator, using her as cover as he assaulted women in the spiritual community. It\u0027s a story of facades, being used, spiritual abuse, blame shifting, putdowns, sexual assault, addiction, hierarchies, predatory behavior, ptsd, and guilt by association. *** CONTENT WARNING - This episode discusses physical abuse and sexual assault. *** If you want to be a guest on our survivor story podcast, please click here or send us an email at narcissistapocalypse@gmail.com To help out our podcast, please fill out our listener survey, click here.
