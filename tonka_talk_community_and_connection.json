      "description": "Ever escape a cult? I did, and I\u0027m ready to share my story. In this episode of Tonka Talk, I share how I broke free from the gripping clutches of Scientology, with my entire family by my side.\u00A0It\u0027s a journey filled with a myriad of emotions, where the final push came from a shooting at a Seattle mall. The following two years were challenging yet liberating, as the support from the Lake Minnetonka community became a beacon of hope in my life.I found solace, understanding, and acceptance in writing for the Lakeshore Weekly, competing in the Mrs Minnesota International Pageant, and volunteering with the Excelsior Fire Department and the Red Cross. The journey may have been tough, but the community made it bearable.But it doesn\u0027t stop there; community and connection continued to play a pivotal role in my life post-Scientology. A violent crime was the initiator to my involvement in Scientology, and ironically it was also the catalyst to my departure.\u00A0The power of community and connection that I discovered in Lake Minnetonka debunked the indoctrinated idea that only Scientologists could truly help people.\u00A0I encourage you to be a part of this enlightening conversation and join our TonkaTalk community.
