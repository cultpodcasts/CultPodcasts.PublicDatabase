In this episode of Wicked Psychotherapists, hosts Tanya and Erin dive into the Netflix documentary \u0027Dancing for the Devil.\u0027 They explore the troubling aspects of 7M, the management group overseeing dancers featured in the documentary, and discuss the potential cult-like elements of the group under pastor Robert Shin\u0027s leadership. The discussion navigates through the complexities of mental health, control, and exploitation, reflecting on different viewpoints, including family dynamics and the search for identity and spirituality. The hosts also engage in a thought-provoking conversation about the ramifications for those involved and the possibility for family reconciliation. Connect with us!
