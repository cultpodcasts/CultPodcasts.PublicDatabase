Jon has years of extensive knowledge and expertise on high control, cultic groups and is passionate about prevention and awareness.

Spiritual groups become problematic,  when members are held to impossible standards, rigid rules are enacted, and individuals are discouraged from having their own thoughts and or opinions.  \n\nRESOURCES:\nFor finding a therapist: \nwww.goodtherapy.org \nwww.psychologytoday.com\nhttps://openpathcollective.org/\nhttps://www.spiritualabuseresources.com/\nhttps://freedomofmind.com/\n\nIf you are curious what IBLP is, or learning more about aspects of high control/cultic groups, please see the videos linked below.\n\nPART 1, 2, and 3 IBLP Deep Dives: \nhttps://youtu.be/vk0i1cNK65E\nhttps://youtu.be/M-TP01Ei2i4\nhttps://youtu.be/nnu6xS-Lr-8\n\nWhat Happens in Religious Cults:\nhttps://youtu.be/epZqgPhxqo0\n\nOther video you may find helpful if you want more information on Josh Duggar:\nhttps://youtu.be/6c91PAFNgZc\nhttps://youtu.be/gQ5UBPumz1A\n\nIf you\u0027re interested in true crime, psychological commentary and analysis of current events, and/or learning about deceptive behavior, I also recommend the series on Elizabeth Holmes\u0027 Theranos Trial:\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNXxatoFNESU9fJw4dXSYHxMNNz1CQFTG\n\n\u2728Love delicious coffee with added nutrients like I do?
