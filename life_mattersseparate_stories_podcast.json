      "description": "Some organisations might seem beneficial, helping to link people into others of like mind. But for some, when they go in further to a group, they realise it has taken over their life.\n\nAfter attending a free clairvoyant reading at a Mind Body Spirit festival, Carli McConkey became trapped in a new-age cult for 13 years.\n\nShe says there are tell-tale signs and calls for police to do more on cult-like groups, ahead of her appearance tonight on SBS Insight program Cult Following.",
