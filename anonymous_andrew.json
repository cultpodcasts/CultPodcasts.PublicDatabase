      "description": "Ep#30 I invite on a member of one of the Facebook groups that have started supporting the families and ex -members and friends of people who are still in the cult. As promised I am doing an in depth investigation into TFU, supporting the people who have been effected by this disgraceful organization. Todays guest shares her story of her Twin Flame relationship and how it is nothing like what is promised by TFU. If you or anyone you know would like to be part of this journey of exposing further TFU please contact me. You can also join the Facebook groups: Escaping Twin Flames Discussion Group \u0026 Twin Flames Universe Exposed where there are thousands of members supporting those who are family members who are cutoff from their sons and daughters still in the cult and anyone who got out.I would like to thank Anonymous Sarah for sharing her story.

I invite Laura Marie Jenks on this episode to discuss the concept of a twin flame and the Twin Flame Universe Cult. Laura is in a Twin Flame relationship by her definition. (Not one of TFU) She shares her concept and origin of the phrase \u0022Twin Flame\u0022. We hope to continue this conversation on this podcast. This organization needs to be outed further. Ultimately brought to their knees. If you are a family member or ex-member of TFU or know any knowledge, including the legal aspect of how they are getting away with this, and would like to be interviewed, please contact me. I would like to thank Laura Marie Jenks for stepping up and speaking out.To connect with Laura on Snapchat.Snapchat: lauraa-mariieeethe Facebook groups I am a member of and who are carrying this discussion and have thousands of members are:(5) Twin Flames Universe Exposed | Facebook(4) Escaping twin flames discussion group | FacebookTo contact me:Anonymous Andrew Podcast-Life \u0026 The Choices We Make.Website: https://www.anonymousandrewpodcast.comInstagram: @anonymousandrewpodcastTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@anonymousandrewpodcastThreads: @anonymousandrewpodcastFacebook: facebook.com/anonymousandrewpodcastYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@anonymousandrewpodcastLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-peters-a8a012285/X: @AAndrewpodcastSocial Media Manager: Lyndsey BrownMusic by: freebeats.io",

      "description": "Bonus Episode: I recorded this to speak directly to the Twin Flames Families, and ex-members and anyone who has been affected by this cult. I want to explain why I am doing this research. I have reached out to several people who were in the documentary (and not) and asked them to come on my podcast and tell their story and give more insight into this cult. You will not be edited, you can speak freely. Unlike Netflix and Amazon where they have editors and producers and time constraints and a narrative, I do not! What you say will be aired, You have the stage!Please consider coming on the show and tell your story, I want to help get the word out there and if it starts with me, it will snowball to other podcasters, I want the government to do something about this. I have a free platform from which you can shout from the mountain top your disgust, your heartbreak and pleas to whomever will listen. I promise you I have no agenda other than you hep you.
