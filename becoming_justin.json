Your messages, comments, and love mean the world to me.\n\n**** SO WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE I RELEASED THOSE FIRST TWO VIDEOS****\nSince I released those videos, I\u2019ve been getting calls, texts, and even voicemails from people within the Jehovah\u2019s Witness religion threatening, harassing me and demanding that I \u201Cexplain myself.\u201D They\u2019re trying to silence me and ban me from speaking my truth. It hasn\u2019t been easy, but if anything, this only makes me more determined to keep sharing my story. My voice will not be silenced. I\u2019m living my truth, and I\u2019ll continue to do so fearlessly.\n\n*** I STILL NEED YOUR HELP***\nI didn\u2019t get to try many things while I was in the cult, but now, the possibilities feel endless. And that\u2019s where YOU come in. I want you to help shape this journey! Drop your suggestions for new adventures, challenges, or experiences in the comments\u2014whether it\u2019s skydiving, cooking, or something totally outside my comfort zone.
