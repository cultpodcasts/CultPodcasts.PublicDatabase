      "description": "This week we cover the the BBC Africa documentary about \u0027Pastor\u0027 TB Joshua. We discuss religion, cults and how such monstrosities were able to be carried out for so long. On a lighter note, we also discuss the new Mean Girls movie, Willy Wonka and the movie releases we\u2019re looking forward to. As always, we mention the documentary we\u0027re covering next week at the end!
