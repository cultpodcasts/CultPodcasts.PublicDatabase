      "description": "Join hosts Jesse and Sam as they take a spirited journey into the world of Bethel Church in Redding, California\u2014where the worship is electric, the teachings are... well, supernatural, and the coffee is probably anointed. From Bethel\u2019s rise as a powerhouse of modern Christianity to its global influence (and occasional eyebrow-raising moments), Jesse and Sam break down what makes this mega-church tick. Is it the miracle healings? The rockstar worship leaders? Or maybe it\u2019s just the sheer volume of fog machines? Along the way, they discuss Bethel\u0027s infamous Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry, the magic of \u0022Jesus culture,\u0022 and why some people think they\u2019re onto something divine while others just want to know if it\u2019s all just a really good cult in disguise. Get ready for a fun, irreverent, and surprisingly deep dive into one of the most talked-about churches of our time!",
