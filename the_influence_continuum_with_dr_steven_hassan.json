      "description": "Human trafficking is defined in international law as the use of fraud, force, or coercion to enslave people. It is a scourge that operates not just through physical coercion but through the devastating use of mind control, a method of psychological enslavement. Rebecca Bender is a courageous survivor and advocate who works tirelessly to empower survivors, train law enforcement, do expert witness work, and assist policymakers. She created the Rebecca Bender Initiative and the online Elevate Academy, which empowers trafficking survivors over the age of eighteen to move forward with their lives. She found encouragement and mentorship from Carissa Phelps and Rachel Thomas, who, with me, developed the Ending the Game ten-session program for trafficking survivors under the age of eighteen. Understanding the tactics traffickers use is critical for prevention, as well as escape and recovery. My discussions with experts and survivors are not just academic; they are practical resources that shine a light on the manipulative strategies used in trafficking. Knowledge of these tactics can be lifesaving for anyone at risk or currently trapped. In this exploration, we delve deep into the intricate web of human trafficking, examining the various manipulative tactics employed by traffickers and the significant role that education and empowerment play in the recovery process.Learn more about Steven Hassan and Freedom of Mind Resource Center.

If so, you can\u0027t afford to miss this interview with Melanie, a Licensed Clinical Social Worker and a survivor of the infamous Troubled Teen Industry \u2014a largely unregulated web of residential behavior modification programs notorious for subjecting struggling teens to various forms of abuse. Our riveting dialogue focuses on these unregulated behavior modification programs\u0027 stark realities and untold abuses. Melanie\u0027s mission is to raise awareness and educate mental health professionals on coercive control settings like these. Why is this essential? Because desperate parents might unknowingly send their vulnerable teens into a dangerous commercial cult.

      "description": "Growing up in the Assemblies of God, the second-largest Pentecostal denomination in the United States with approximately three million members, Paul Jensen witnessed firsthand the controversial culture and beliefs that define this religious movement. Founded in 1914 and initially considered a fringe group by mainstream Protestant denominations, the Assemblies of God gradually gained acceptance. However, as Paul discovered, this movement\u2019s high-demand and questionable history are often concealed from public scrutiny. He shared his journey of discovery after growing up in the Assemblies of God, the world\u2019s largest denomination of the Pentecostal and Charismatic \u201CSpirit Led\u201D movement. He reveals the little-known authoritarian cult roots of the Assemblies of God and how the church has created an official narrative that conceals its true history. Unfortunately, the protections of law that prohibit religious groups from engaging in supporting political campaigns has been sidestepped in the USA, so understanding the fraud used to control members and their beliefs that they \u201Chear from God\u201D has caused intense polarization with all who do not subscribe to their \u201Ccertainty\u201D of commitment.

Formerly a true believer pundit for the MAGA movement, Rich\u2019s transformation offers a deep dive into the mechanics of belief, mind control, the allure of belonging, and the power of self-reflection and transformation. Rich Logis was a podcaster and deeply committed MAGA activist. His journey resonates with what I\u2019ve observed repeatedly: deceptive recruitment, emotional manipulation, and information control that exploits the deep-seated human need to belong and make a difference. Yet, the moment of awakening and subsequent transformation makes his narrative genuinely captivating. Now, as he says, he\u2019s working to bring good news to the afflicted and to help others leave MAGA and exit the closed system of demonizing all opponents.\nLearn more about Steven Hassan and Freedom of Mind Resource Center.

      "description": "Large Group Awareness Trainings (LGATs) bill themselves as transformational multi-day workshops. You often feel pressured to attend, perhaps by your corporation or a family member or friend, and you are deliberately not told what will happen there. These workshops often utilize eight to twelve-hour marathon sessions to wear down a person\u0027s identity. According to research by South African Dr. John Hunter, they artificially create bipolar states in participants. Hunter offers a fresh and unique analytical framework to explain the highs people experience at the end of a \u0022training.\u0022 He is a researcher and lecturer based in Johannesburg. His interest in large group awareness trainings \u2013 and their impact on mood and psychosis \u2013 is grounded in his personal experience of bipolar disorder and his participation in an LGAT in 2010. Dr. Hunter put forward the Dopaminergic-Defense Hypothesis, which offers insights into both (i) the \u0022transformational\u0022 experiences associated with LGAT participation and (ii) the common claims of psychological harm and problematic behavior associated with LGAT participation. In 2022, he published an article summarizing the mechanism behind the dopaminergic defense in the Journal for the Cognitive Science of Religion (Hunter, 2022). Hunter and I believe the stress and hyperarousal methods occur in many different environments including authoritarian cults and religious groups. This interview is fascinating.

      "description": "One of the hottest topics in modern psychology is utilizing psychedelics to aid psychotherapy. Research is being conducted on the potentially beneficial use of substances like psilocybin, LSD, DMT, and MDMA in a controlled environment. In recent years, it\u2019s gotten attention for its efficacy in treating treatment-resistant depression and PTSD, addiction, and end-of-life anxiety. Related to this is the psychedelic underground, a movement that similarly wants to use these substances to improve lives but takes a different, more spiritual approach. I spoke with Rachel Harris, who has experience in both, about this exciting world. Rachel is the author of Swimming in the Sacred: Wisdom from the Psychedelic Underground and Listening to Ayahuasca: New Hope for Depression, Addiction, PTSD, and Anxiety. A psychologist who has been in private practice for 40 years, she spent ten years in an academic research department where she published more than 40 scientific studies in peer-reviewed journals and received a National Institutes of Health New Investigator\u2019s Award.

      "description": "Ramadan was freed from prison on March 15th 2023, after 51 years of incarceration by\u00A0\u00A0the parole board and finally Governor Baker who commuted his life sentence. A Vietnam vet Shabazz suffered PTSD and drug addiction upon his return from service and got involved in armed robbery that\u00A0\u00A0resulted in the deaths of two innocent people. He was initially sentenced to death. Ramadan Shabazz is a rare success story and a model that proves a person who commits a horrible crime can reform and truly become a model citizen. In 1983, he began his 40-year association with the Parker family. While incarcerated, Ramadan earned his bachelor\u0027s degree and master\u0027s degree from Boston University. He also participated in programs to assist other prisoners with mental health struggles. Ramadan Shabazz and my friend, Dr. Richard Parker, joined me on the Influence Continuum podcast this week to discuss his life journey and the phenomenal effort to help him be a free man today. This is a heartwarming story which brings much needed light on a prison system that deserves reformation. Learn more about Steven Hassan and Freedom of Mind Resource Center.

      "description": "With Scientologist celebrity Danny Masterson being sentenced to 30 years in jail for brutal rapes recently, I want people to hear from a woman who was forced to grow up in this notorious cult., Katherine Spallino, the author of a new book, The Bad Cadet: Growing Up in the Church of Scientology\u2019s Sea Organization, has had quite a life journey. Katherine grew up on a secluded ranch within the cadet org, Scientology\u2019s Sea Org school for children. At a young age, Katherine began to journal about her day-to-day life, capturing the thoughts and experiences of a child coming of age in a cult. Katherine\u2019s background offers the rare opportunity to tell the story of the hundreds of children who rarely saw their parents and were indoctrinated to become future Sea Org members. The Sea Org is considered the \u201Celite\u201D part of the cult, and members are made to commit to a billion-year contract. In other words, this lifetime and many future lifetimes. Potential Sea Org members take part in both manual labor and indoctrination classes. Katherine\u2019s book is unique because it is told by someone who journaled as a child.

      "description": "I speak with the acclaimed psychiatrist and my mentor, Robert Jay Lifton, M.D., about his new book, Surviving Our Catastrophes: Resilience and Renewal from Hiroshima to the Covid-19 Pandemic. Lifton\u2019s research on thought reform and the psychology of totalism, specifically his study on \u201Cbrainwashing\u201D in China, has been widely regarded as groundbreaking. His book Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism (1961) was used in my deprogramming. It was Lifton who encouraged my career which has spanned 47 years. In this new book, Lifton delves into \u201CSurvivor Power\u201D and the transformation from victimhood to survivorship. He emphasizes the importance of drawing on the knowledge and wisdom gained from surviving traumatic experiences to continue living meaningful lives. The book takes inspiration from historical examples of survivors who have endured unimaginable suffering and trauma. Lifton highlights the remarkable responses of individuals who, in the face of unspeakable horror, have created activist movements, converted their experiences into art and literature, and demonstrated the resilience of the human spirit. From the people of Hiroshima, who responded to the atomic bombing by creating an activist \u201Ccity of peace,\u201D to the survivors of Nazi death camps who combated mass killing and showcased their healing through art and literature, these examples serve as beacons of hope.

Years after she and other mental health experts warned Trump was unfit and a danger to the public, we continue to see vivid proof that the public has suffered by censoring experts! Her recent book is Profile of a Nation: Trump\u2019s Mind, America\u2019s Soul. What was behind the mainstream media silencing of credible experts like Dr. Lee and myself? We discuss this and many important topics like the \u201Cduty to warn\u201D and the importance of mental health, especially in people who are supposed to be public servants. We discuss the 25th Amendment of the Constitution and how it could be bolstered to prevent anyone who is so grossly incompetent from coming to the Presidency again. We also discuss the corrupt and authoritarian family court system in the United States- the subject of a forthcoming book. Learn more about Steven Hassan and Freedom of Mind Resource Center.

In 2021, they were at their highest ever at almost 50,000 murders, suicides, and accidental deaths involving firearms. These statistics are personal to me due to my experiences in the Moonies cult with the Rod of Iron Ministries, Kahr Arms, the AR15 factory, and two compounds (TN and TX) training people for civil war. I spoke with expert Jonathan Lowy who told me he successfully sued Kahr Arms. Jonathan founded Global Action on Gun Violence, a nonprofit working with the international community to stop gun trafficking and violence through litigation, human rights, and other strategies. He has been litigating and advocating against gun violence for over 25 years. He helped win over $100 million for victims in verdicts and settlements, created the precedent that holds gun companies accountable and reformed dangerous gun industry practices. His articles include \u201CThe Right Not to Be Shot.\u201D He has been named one of the 500 leading lawyers in America for over ten years by Lawdragon magazine.

In 2021, she created the website Abuse in Kundalini Yoga, a platform aimed at exposing and addressing sexual abuse, child abuse, homophobia, exploitation, business fraud, and drugs and arms trafficking within the community. If you have ever seen white-turbaned people calling themselves Sikhs, done yoga, or gone to a workshop, you will be educated about the reality of this billion-dollar corporate empire.

Michelle was raised on a mountain in the Angeles National Forest, where she learned to identify flora and fauna, navigate by the stars, forage for edible plants, and care for the earth. A highly accomplished journalism professor and contributor to many top national publications, she was the 2022 Faculty Lecturer of the Year at Chaffey College. She founded the award-winning literary journal and creative collective, The Chaffey Review, advises Student Media, and teaches poetry and critical thinking in the California Institutions for Men and Women in Chino. Interestingly, former Manson follower Leslie Van Houten assisted her courses for incarcerated women.

      "description": "Parental alienation is a highly destructive form of undue influence where one parent systematically manipulates their children to reject the other parent. This damaging form of psychological abuse not only disrupts family dynamics but can also leave lasting emotional scars on the child, potentially impacting their development, mental health, and future relationships. Often, children are not only alienated from their mother or their father but the entire side of the family, traumatizing all who are related. The BITE Model of Authoritarian Control can be used to analyze any case. I have previously done multiple blogs on this topic. Dana Laquidara, a professional author and writer, brings a unique perspective as an adult survivor of parental alienation. Through this memoir, she seeks to raise awareness and support parents and children ensnared in this devastating form of mind control and abuse.

Although I am Jewish by faith, I support the principles of Christianity and all major religions that promote truth, peace, love, and forgiveness. Their collaborative work, QAnon, Chaos, and the Cross, is a compendium of essays exploring the rise of conspiracies like QAnon, an online conspiracy group I wrote about in my book, The Cult of Trump. Their book raises awareness about the allures and pitfalls of conspiracy theories and draws upon Christian principles for discerning truth from misinformation and fostering productive dialogues. Anger and fear are potent emotions that tend to override our critical thinking and common sense, sometimes leading to falling out with loved ones who have an opposing view to our own. Accepting a conspiracy theory as fact does not make a person weak, stupid, or gullible.

Want to understand more about our current Supreme Court and why they demonstrated that they lied during their confirmation hearings when they said that Roe v. Wade was established law after fifty years. As soon as they had the majority, they showed their true allegiance, and it wasn\u0027t to the law and the majority of the American people. Mary Jo McConahay is a Catholic journalist who takes the position of supporting the changes in Vatican 2, which included allowing the mass to be given in languages other than Latin. Vatican 2 stated categorically that Jews were not Christ-killers but affirmed God is Almighty and that His promise to Abraham was eternal. We discuss the Manhattan Declaration which was signed by Catholics and Protestants to work together to undermine gay rights, and women\u2019s right to choose and to promote the freedom to religious impose their version of religion on all others.

Gaslighting is a devastating form of undue influence. It occurs when an individual manipulates another person by distorting, twisting, and dismissing their experiences, making them question their memories, perceptions, and reality. Gaslighting can occur in a romantic relationship, among family members, in the workplace, within mind control cults as well as by politicians. Robin Stern, Ph.D., has been a practicing psychoanalyst for over thirty years and is the co-founder and associate director of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence.

However, many of its beliefs and practices fall under my BITE Model of Authoritarian Control, which I developed to evaluate control of Behavior, Information, Thoughts, and Emotions. To gain more insight into this organization, I invited Dr. Steve Daily, a former pastor of the SDA, to share his valuable personal and professional experiences. Dr. Steve Daily is a licensed psychologist, church historian, and accomplished author who has written 28 books, including 11 on Seventh-day Adventism and its founder Ellen G. White. He grew up in an Adventist home and received his education from Adventist institutions. In 2010, Dr. Daily left Adventism and went on to work as a psychologist at UCLA. Since then, he has become an outspoken critic of founder Ellen G. White and the Adventist Church, authoring Ellen G. White A Psychobiography. The book explores whether the accusations of fraud and pathology leveled against her over the years stand up to historical and psychological scrutiny.\u00A0 Learn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "Shepherding/discipling Bible cults like the International Churches of Christ have an authoritarian structure with the \u201Capostle\u201D or \u201Cprophet\u201D being the person closest to God and everyone else having a human to disciple over them all the way down. It is patently abusive by its nature as it is based on submission of one\u2019s own conscience and following directions of a person who is in the \u201Crole of Jesus\u201D over them. Lawsuits are being filed on behalf of those victimized in the cult, some of whom were sexually assaulted in the group and no responsible action was taken. Over one million people have been involved with this group, most of whom have exited. Most have never spoken out about the abuses they experienced- including breaking sessions, excessive pressure to donate money, or the loss of their personal autonomy and sense of self. If you are interested in legal issues or have been in a controlling Christian group of any kind, you will want to listen to this fascinating episode.

Prohibit blood transfusions? Shun former members? Or that they have had a huge pedophile problem for many decades? They are very nice, hard-working people, but involvement in this group has caused much suffering and harm worldwide. Learn more about Steven Hassan and Freedom of Mind Resource Center.

      "description": "On the ethical side of the Influence Continuum,\u00A0we invite an expert to discuss preparing how to do ethical parenting. Julie Hartman is a Certified Birth Doula, Certified Lactation Counselor, and New Parent Educator. She supports families in the perinatal period through support groups and teaching classes on living with a newborn. Most importantly, she is the mom of three adult children and can connect with the people she works with through shared experiences. We discuss what a doula and lactation counselor is, as many people are unaware. Julie tells us a birth doula is often confused with a midwife, but they are different. Whereas the role of a midwife requires formal medical training, birth doulas support the family before, during, and after birth. They assist the family in empowering and speaking up for themselves so that they can advocate for their needs in the birthing process. Birth Doulas also help educate families on the decisions that could need to be made during a hospital birth so there are no surprises and families can think those options through before they are in the heat of the moment. Julie shares her expertise in ethical, positive parenting techniques. Learn more about Steven Hassan and Freedom of Mind Resource Center.

      "description": "Rachel Maddow\u2019s podcast, Ultra, is about Nazism in the United States in the 1930s and 1940s. She based her podcast on the scholarly work of a Jesuit historian Professor Charles R. Gallagher, and his award-winning book.\u00A0I was fascinated to learn more and discovered that he teaches at nearby Boston College. So we met for lunch, and he kindly consented to this fascinating interview. I learned that the Nazis sent agents such as Charles Scholtz to Boston to recruit and radicalize Americans. These agents wanted to prevent the United States from coming to the defense of the United Kingdom and other European countries. The Nazis did not want America to help Jews who were persecuted and exterminated. Father Charles Coughlin was a Roman Catholic priest and radio personality with a listenership of 30 million people. He was a vocal supporter of the Christian Front. He praised Hitler\u2019s efforts to combat communism and advocated for a similar approach in the United States. Coughlin also used his radio broadcasts to spread anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and to attack Jewish people and Jewish-owned businesses. Coughlin also supported fascist regimes in Europe. In the 1940s, Coughlin and some of his followers began to plot a violent coup to overthrow the US government. The Nazis are still actively promoting violent fascism.

Having interviewed over 10,000 members of Gen Z, she provides invaluable insights into what the next decade and beyond will bring. The digital age has brought about a massive change in the way we think, feel, communicate, and behave.

In this episode, I am honored to interview Dr. Tony Attwood, one of the world\u2019s foremost experts on Autism Spectrum Disorder. His first book, Asperger\u2019s Syndrome: A Guide for Parents and Professionals, is widely considered the foundational book on the subject. In past decades, I have had many clients who were on the spectrum and I long ago realized they are particularly vulnerable to authoritarian cults, as well as being radicalized online to do acts of terrorism. Years ago I taught an online webinar to warm folks and their families about their vulnerability to undue influence. Folks on the spectrum can be absolute geniuses and over the centuries have made major contributions. That said, these gifts can be manipulated and abused to harm or help others.

      "description": "Rewired is one of the most important new books I have read that has yet to get significant media attention. Dr. Marci is a Harvard psychiatrist and social neuroscientist who uses incontrovertible scientific evidence in this remarkable and sobering book. He has a chapter titled \u2018The Power of the Prefrontal Cortex\u2019 that describes it as the \u2018most highly evolved part of the modern human brain.\u2019 It performs executive functions and is an \u2018orchestral conductor of neuronal symphonies\u2019 in our brain. One of the central premises of this book is that our obsession with social media and cell phones is rewiring our brains and causing irreversible damage. Specific advice on what we can do to have a healthy tech-life balance is given and discussed. Please listen to this fascinating and essential conversation at this pivotal time in human history. We need to control our technology and not allow our technology to control or unduly influence us.  Learn more about Steven Hassan and Freedom of Mind Resource Center.

Let\u2019s expand the exit ramp to using conscience and employing American values. Let\u2019s not shame or denigrate folks for being sucked into the Republican machine.

The Information Professionals Association (IPA) co-founder, Dr. Rand Waltzman, has over 40 years of experience performing and managing research in AI applied to domains including social media and cognitive security in the information environment. His distinguished career includes being the former Deputy Chief Technology Officer and Senior Information Scientist at the Rand Corporation. His perspective is dire. He says that without dramatic intervention into data privacy and technology regulations worldwide, those with power will be able to conduct massive mind control at scale, as we see in current dictatorships. He agrees that the human mind is easily manipulated, provided a person doesn\u2019t understand how social psychology principles and propaganda techniques are being used on them. There is no freedom without responsibility. Virtual Reality (VR) technology is able to obtain vast amounts of information about a user\u2019s mind that can be used to manipulate and control them.

      "description": "Mike Rinder escaped his 46 years of Scientology, having achieved the #3 spot of power and head of their intelligence unit OSA. His new book helps pull back the curtain on many aspects of this notorious authoritarian cult. He starred with Leah Remini on Scientology and the Aftermath, and now their podcast Fair Game. In this special interview, I cover some essential details that folks (especially cult watchers) will wish to know. For example, he answers my specific questions that help connect the dots with the criminal activity and mind control that Hubbard enshrined into cult doctrine. In this age of mass radicalization, understanding Scientology cult mind control offers a window to understand how intelligent and educated people can fall prey to malignant narcissists. It also proves that people (including top leaders) can exit and become contributing members of society. Learn more about Steven Hassan and Freedom of Mind Resource Center.

Sarma co-founded Pure Food and Wine restaurant in NYC and founded the raw vegan brand, One Lucky Duck. The series failed utterly by not explaining how predators operate, or how hypnosis can be used to elicit obedience and induce amnesia. In this case, large sums were drained from Sarma\u0027s business, and both she and her predator were jailed at Rikers Island, prosecuted as if both had criminal intent. This episode is for anyone wishing to understand how an educated, intelligent woman\u0027s business and life were obliterated via years-long grooming and mind control.

He was a senior civilian military intelligence analyst responsible for the Balkans and the former Soviet Union. Following the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s, from outside and inside the former Yugoslavia, James learned a great deal about how political and religious ideologies interact and combine into ethno-nationalist projects that delegitimize left-wing governing philosophies (that often end in genocide).  His expertise on 4th generation warfare has wide-reaching implications for today. Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",

He has worked tirelessly to understand and reveal its true history with the KKK and its influence on modern Pentecostalism today. He has authored two books and built an incredible website to expose the facts of this criminal, white supremacist, misogynistic cult. John helps us realize an essential part of American authoritarianism which to this day has an international following. By freeing himself from the mental and emotional damage he suffered as a child growing up in that atmosphere, he can help millions realize they were following a false prophet, believing they are just being \u201CChristian.\u201D There is a growing movement of people realizing it was really about power, money, sex and politics, and not religion.

At 94 years young, Koch has been a respected voice on ethical parenting for decades. In this conversation, she highlights her main ideas about parenting and shares interesting stories from her past. I have been recommending this book to second-generation former cult members in my work. I do this because when they read it, they realize what healthy parenting should have been and it helps them for their future with their children.

Dr. Lee taught at Yale and Yale Law School from 2003-2020 and became known to the public by leading a group of mental health experts in breaking the silence about the dangerous mental impairments of Donald Trump. She edited the book \u201CThe Dangerous Case of Donald Trump,\u201D with 37 experts weighing in on their concerns about Trump. She\u2019s been heavily censored in the media due to the American Psychiatric Association citing \u201CThe Goldwater Rule\u201D, but they are a private institution and have power only over their members. Dr. Lee is not a member. Nevertheless, Dr. Lee believes that all medical professionals have a \u201Cduty to warn.\u201D In this fascinating conversation, we talk about a wide range of topics. She too believes that trained mental health professionals are a valued resource in the media and are not called on to help the public enough.
