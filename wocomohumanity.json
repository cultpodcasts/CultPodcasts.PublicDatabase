      "description": "The wild 1970s. A quest for higher consciousness, spirituality and sexual freedom. In\nhis Ashram in Poona, Bhagwan urges his disciples to meditate and practise tantric sex in order\nto reach a higher level of consciousness. Hugh, the guru\u2019s bodyguard, watches his ascent on\npeople. Sheela becomes his secretary and the powerful boss of Bhagwan\u2019s community in the\nmountains of Oregon. The guru, decried as \u201Dsex-guru\u201D by the Western media in the 1970s, is\nnow making headlines with his Rolls-Royces. The dream turns into a nightmare, for Hugh into a\nmental breakdown, for Sheela into a prison sentence. Where did it all begin to go wrong?\n\n-------\nChapters\n\u25B7 0:00:00 - Intro\n\u25B7 0:03:58 - Rajneesh as a religious movement\n\u25B7 0:06:50 - Osho\u0027s family background\n\u25B7 0:13:09 - Bhagwan Rajneesh\n\u25B7 0:14:53 - Feelings\n\u25B7 0:17:16 - The pressure on Rajneesh\n\u25B7 0:03:58 - Rajneesh as a religious movement\n\u25B7 0:23:07 - Love for life\n\u25B7 0:26:30 - Paradise\n\u25B7 0:31:31 - Therapy\n\u25B7 0:47:58 - The beginning\n\u25B7 0:49:22 - Working Vision\n\u25B7 0:51:45 - Big Muddy Ranch\n\u25B7 1:33:13 - Credits\n\n#documentary #osho #guru #bhagwan #wildwildcountry \n-------\nSubscribe to wocomoHUMANITY: https://goo.gl/5Sp36B\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/wocomo\n-------\n\nOriginal title: GURU - Bhagwan, his Secretary \u0026 his Bodyguard\n\nDirected by Sabine Gisiger \u0026 Beat H\u00E4ner\n\n\u00A9 2013, Licensed by Magnetfilm\n------- \n\nDocumentaries about people and cultures from around the globe: wocomoHUMANITY offers high-quality content which is produced by leading production companies. \n\nCheck out our other channels to watch high quality documentaries:\n\u25B7 wocomoDOCS: https://www.youtube.com/wocomoDOCS\n\u25B7 wocomoWILDLIFE: https://www.youtube.com/wocomoWILDLIFE\n\u25B7 wocomoHISTORY: https://www.youtube.com/wocomoHISTORY\n\u25B7 wocomoTRAVEL: https://www.youtube.com/wocomoTRAVEL\n\u25B7 wocomoCOOK: https://www.youtube.com/wocomoCOOK\n\nWocomo HUMANITY is part of the Wocomo channel network by NIKITA VENTURES.
