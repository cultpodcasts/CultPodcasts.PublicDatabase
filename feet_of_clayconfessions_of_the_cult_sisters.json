      "description": "Loren Cunningham, founder of Youth With A Mission (YWAM), passed away on October 6, 2023.\u00A0 News of his passing was particularly difficult for MANY former members (YWAMers) because he escaped a long-overdue reckoning to account for the years of exploitation, manipulation, and spiritual and financial abuse he designed and presided over throughout the decades of Youth With A Mission\u2019s history.\u00A0 Tracey and Sharon share their own experiences with this systemic model of abuse and manipulation due to the close ties between Keith Green and Loren Cunningham and between Last Days Ministries and Youth With a Mission back in the early 1980\u2019s.\u00A0 Loren Cunningham exploited both youth and nations with a program that functioned much more like a multi-level marketing scheme (MLM) than a true ministry. We share the dark side of his\u00A0 \u2018legacy\u2019 that you won\u2019t often hear because Loren Cunningham and other high-level YWAM leaders worked hard to remove and silence people and bury and hide important and heart-breaking stories of abuse and corruption.\u00A0\u00A0References for this episode: Tyler Morning Telegraph Newspaper article\u00A0 \u2013 History of Ministries in East Texashttps://tylerpaper.com/lifestyle/faith/christian-pioneers-make-east-texas-a-hub-for-worldwide-ministries/article_3bfb0beb-9f0a-578c-8236-8549236a5233.htmlThe Cross and the Switch Blade Movie Trailer starring Erik Estrada (who starred in the TV Show CHiPs in the 1970\u2019s)https://youtu.be/w4ANAyIQi8Y?si=YWzERVCizDfyYFdpThe Book used by YWAM to emphasize the principle \u2013 \u201CDo not come against God\u2019s anointed.\u201DThe Tale of Three Kings\u2013 by Gene Edwards\u00A0Sharon mentions visiting the home of the Anastasis Ship in 1982: \u00A0Loren Cunningham had a long-time vision of a ship ministry, which was finally realized in 1979. The first ship, named \u201CAnastasis\u201D (the Greek word for Resurrection), became the first in a fleet to be known as Mercy Ships\u2013a ministry which would provide hope and healthcare to the needy in port cities around the world.(Note:\u00A0 Mercy Ships is no longer an affiliate of YWAM \u2013 it became a stand-alone ministry in 2003)\u00A0Other Stories about experiences with YWAM abuse:https://ministrywatch.com/spiritual-abuse-a-common-complaint-for-ywam-students/https://www.spiritualabuseresources.com/articles/my-experience-in-ywaTracey\u0027s Interview on IWATF: \u0022Was Keith Green A Cult Leader?\u0022 https://www.buzzsprout.com/2078827/12748626 Sharon\u0027s Interview on IWATF: \u0022Keith Green Arranged My Teenage Marriage\u0022https://www.buzzsprout.com/2078827/12748728A little slice of life at the cult-commune Last Days Ministries:https://www.buzzsprout.com/2078827/13460453Revisiting the Book, https://www.instagram.com/feetofclay.cultsistershttps://feetofclayconfessionsofthecultsisters.buzzsprout.comWe love acronyms -- and we aren\u0027t afraid to use them!
