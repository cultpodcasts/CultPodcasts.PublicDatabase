I\u0027m your host, Scott Lloyd, and I\u0027m thrilled to be here with Daniella Mestyanek Young, a scholar in this field and author of the compelling memoir, \u0022Uncultured.\u0022 Daniella, how are you today? Daniella: I\u0027m doing great, Scott! Thanks for having me. Scott: Fantastic! I\u0027m excited to kick off this podcast with you. I must say, your book \u0022Uncultured\u0022 has been an incredible resource for me. Growing up in a small Pentecostal cult, known as the United Pentecostal Church, your experiences really resonated with me. Throughout our podcast, I\u0027ll share some of my own stories, but your journey from the Children of God cult to the United States Army is extraordinary. Your book provides such a detailed account, and I highly recommend everyone read it. For those who prefer audio, it\u0027s available and even made it to the New York Times bestseller list. Daniella: Thank you so much, Scott. I\u0027m glad to hear the book has had such an impact. Scott: For our listeners who might not be familiar with your story, could you share a bit about your experiences? We\u2019re titling this episode \u0022Patriot Pains: I Joined the Army and All I Got Was This Lousy Trauma,\u0022 and I\u2019m particularly interested in how you compare your time in the Children of God cult with your service in the Army. Daniella: Absolutely. First, I want to clarify that while the media often labels the Children of God as a \u0022sex cult,\u0022 it\u0027s important to understand that cults, in general, share common patterns of behavior and control, regardless of their specific doctrines. That said, the Children of God did have a significant focus on sexual doctrines, which were central to their beliefs. I was born into the Children of God, three generations deep. My family was deeply embedded in its leadership\u2014my grandmother donated the first house to the leader, David Berg, and my grandfather still manages the cult\u0027s finances. My father also played a significant role in handling the money. This is all detailed in my book, \u0022Uncultured.\u0022 The Children of God started in 1968 in California, like many cults of that era. David Berg took evangelical control of sex, mixed it with elements of Mormonism, and called it \u0022free love,\u0022 which I describe as forced polyamory. The cult rebranded itself over the years\u2014from being labeled a \u0022harem photo sex cult\u0022 on the cover of Time Magazine in the 80s to performing at the White House in the 90s. Scott: Wow, that\u2019s a remarkable transformation. Daniella: Yes, it is. But despite the rebranding, the core practices and control mechanisms remained the same. I was eventually kicked out at 15, and as you\u2019ll see throughout this podcast, I was never someone who would conform to that environment. Scott: Your transition from the Children of God to the Army is fascinating. How did you end up comparing the two environments? Daniella: There are surprising similarities between extreme groups, whether it\u0027s a cult or a highly structured organization like the Army. Both environments use intense control and indoctrination techniques, which can be quite traumatic. My story is about navigating these systems and finding my own path. Scott: This is going to be an enlightening conversation. Thank you for sharing, Daniella. Let\u0027s dive into more of your experiences and insights.",

I\u0027m your host, Scott Lloyd, and I\u0027m here with Daniella Mestyanek Young, a scholar of cults, extreme groups, and extremely bad leadership. Daniella, how are you today? Daniella: I\u0027m doing great, Scott! How about you? Scot: I\u0027m good, thanks! I see you\u2019ve been super busy lately. Every time I open Instagram or TikTok, you\u2019re going live. How do you manage to talk so much from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.? Daniella: (Laughs) It\u0027s funny you mention that. When recording the audiobook for \u0022Uncultured,\u0022 I discovered I have no trouble talking for seven to nine hours a day. While others worry about losing their voice, that wasn\u2019t the hard part for me. Right now, I\u2019m talking to a lot of people about cults, which are a hot topic these days. Historically, cults thrive during times of societal change because people crave clarity and leadership. Scot: That makes sense, given everything going on. Your book, \u0022Uncultured,\u0022 is fantastic and really sheds light on your experiences growing up in the Children of God cult and later joining the Army. I recently moved to Springfield, Illinois, and saw your book featured as a must-read at Barnes \u0026 Noble. Congrats on all the success! Daniella: Thank you so much! I love seeing those photos of \u0022Uncultured\u0022 in the wild. I appreciate the introduction. As you mentioned, I grew up in the Children of God cult, which is one of the worst you\u2019ll hear about on this podcast. I later joined the U.S. Army and earned a master\u0027s degree in Industrial/Organizational Psychology from Harvard Extension School. Now, I\u2019m a scholar of cults, extreme groups, and extremely bad leadership. I compare what I do to an intelligence officer\u0027s work, helping people understand group behavior and recognize cult tactics in everyday life. Scot: Absolutely. Your book has been a great resource in understanding my own experiences with the United Pentecostal Church, which had many cult-like behaviors, especially in policing the bodies of women. These groups often use appearance and attitude policing to control individuals, stripping away their individuality. Daniella: Exactly. Cults exist for labor and control, using predictable patterns of coercive control. Appearance and attitude policing are key tactics. We\u2019ll discuss this more in our episode on self-sacrifice, but the goal is always to erase the individual for the group\u2019s or leader\u2019s benefit. Scot: That loss of individualism is a common thread in many cults and extreme groups. For example, in the Pentecostal church, the exuberant worship practices often lead to a collective loss of self, making individuals more susceptible to groupthink and control. Daniella: Yes, chanting and group activities make us highly susceptible to suggestion. It\u2019s a common tactic in cults and other controlling environments. We\u2019ll explore this further in the podcast, breaking down my 10-part definition of cults and comparing these tactics to behaviors in everyday groups and systems. Scot: I\u2019m thrilled about this podcast and the opportunity to learn from you. Why do you think cults are such a hot topic right now? Daniella: America is going through significant societal changes, similar to the 70s. People are seeking clarity and community, making them more vulnerable to cults. Additionally, we\u2019re revisiting social issues and questioning longstanding systems like patriarchy, racism, and capitalism. Cult tactics are everywhere, and it\u2019s crucial to recognize them to navigate these systems better. Scot: Well said. This podcast aims to educate and help people understand the toxic elements in groups and systems. I invite everyone to join us on this journey.
