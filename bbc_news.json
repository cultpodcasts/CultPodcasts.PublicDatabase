      "description": "Lighthouse promises life coaching to help people realise their dreams. But an 18-month investigation by the BBC found it takes over people\u0027s lives, separates people from their loved ones and harasses its critics.\n\nLife coaching is a booming UK industry. There are an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 people working in the field. \n\nUnlike many therapists or counsellors most coaches generally say they focus more on clients\u0027 futures. In theory at least, they try to help people work out what they really want and how to get there.\n\nPlease subscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\n#Lighthouse #BBCNews",
