Through a combination of survivor testimonials and dramatic reenactments, it portrays the escalating paranoia and erratic behavior of Reverend Jim Jones as internal and external pressures mount. Congressman Leo Ryan\u0027s insistence on visiting triggers a tense standoff as Jones vacillates between allowing and resisting the visit. Unexpected defections during the visit catch Jones off guard, prompting drastic actions. In the end over 900 individuals, including men, women, and children, found themselves entangled in a web of manipulation and coercion, ultimately resulting in a devastating loss of life.\n\n\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\nSubscribe FD True Crime for free: \nInstagram: https://instagram.com/free.documentary/\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\n\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\n#Crime #Documentary #cults #truecrimestories \n\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\u25AC\n\u0022Welcome to our FD True Crime channel!
