      "description": "Craig shares his powerful story of returning to Invercargill after leaving the Exclusive Brethren, recounting the heartache of family rejection and a poignant encounter with his little sister. We explore the deep complexities of healing from religious trauma and the challenges faced when leaving a high-control community, emphasising that healing is about gaining freedom from the past, not erasing it. Craig sheds light on the fear and surveillance tactics employed by these communities against those who choose to leave and the cultural adjustments required to adapt to mainstream society. Reflecting on his journey of self-discovery and the importance of personal identity, Craig\u2019s insights highlight the need for sensitivity and respect when engaging with those who\u2019ve left insular religious backgrounds. Who Is Craig? Craig Hoyle grew up in Invercargill within the New Zealand Exclusive Brethren. Separated from public society, he attended Brethren-only schooling and worked in his family\u0027s tyre shop. After facing interrogations and conversion therapy for his sexuality, he was excommunicated from the Brethren and lost his family in 2009. Today he is a news director for the Sunday Star-Times. He has worked for newsrooms such as TV3 and RadioLive, and behind the scenes on current affairs shows including 60 Minutes and 3rd Degree. He lives in Auckland, New Zealand.

      "description": "Craig, author of Excommunicated, shares his journey growing up within the Exclusive Brethren, a high-control religious group where strict doctrines governed every aspect of life. Realising his community\u0027s isolation wasn\u0027t the norm, Craig embarked on a path of faith deconstruction and self-discovery, facing profound challenges around identity, sexuality, and belonging. Through heartfelt reflections, he recounts the painful experiences of coming out, being excommunicated, and confronting the emotional toll of family estrangement. Craig\u0027s story highlights the complex process of building a life outside the only world he\u2019d known, using humour as a coping mechanism and finding resilience in the face of trauma and cultural disorientation. This conversation provides a rare glimpse into the lasting impacts of strict religious control and the courageous pursuit of self-acceptance.\n\n\nWho Is Craig?\n\n\nCraig Hoyle grew up in Invercargill within the New Zealand Exclusive Brethren.

Jamie grappled with conflicting beliefs about faith, morality, and her early awareness of her queer identity, leading to deep spiritual trauma. In her memoir, You Lied to Me about God, she confronts the religious shame and guilt she endured, advocating for a spirituality that honours her authentic self. Jamie emphasises the importance of chosen family and community support in the healing process, offering listeners hope and encouragement to explore their own spiritual paths, challenge harmful narratives, and embrace a compassionate, inclusive understanding of faith.\n\n\nWho Is Jamie? \n\n\nDr. Jamie\u002B Marich (she/they/we) began her career as a humanitarian aid worker in Bosnia-Herzegovina where they primarily taught English and music from 2000 to 2003.

      "description": "In a heartfelt exploration of religious trauma, Sam and Clare delve into Clare\u0027s experiences as a pastor\u0027s daughter in a high-control church. Clare reflects on the authoritarian, misogynistic dynamics of her upbringing, revealing how these shaped her identity through expectations of perfection and submission. The discussion broadens to examine religious control\u0027s impact, including conversion therapy practices and LGBTQ\u0026#43; rights. Clare\u2019s journey of breaking free, becoming a whistleblower, and advocating for others underscores her resilience, even as she navigates the challenges of familial ties. Her humour and authenticity offer hope and empower listeners to embrace healing, self-care, and reclaiming their values. Who Is Clare? Clare Heath-McIvor, formerly known as Kit Kennedy in the blogging and podcasting world, is a dedicated communications professional with specialisations in research writing, manuscript development, and non-fiction publishing. She\u2019s passionate about helping people understand their experiences within evangelicalism and high-demand groups, empowering them to navigate life beyond those frameworks. A proud mum to two spirited souls, Clare balances life as a businesswoman, advocate, and church survivor who has even taken her turn as a whistleblower. Though naps rank high on her list of passions, Clare is deeply committed to her journey through theology and faith deconstruction, which she chronicles with honesty and optimism. Her blog began as an outlet for exploring theology but evolved into a profound journey of faith deconstruction and discovery, leading her to a new way of engaging with spirituality. Today, Clare writes from a place of peace, aiming for that grounded perspective to resonate through her words. In early 2020, she launched Unchurchable, a podcast for those who find spirituality more accessible than traditional church structures. Whether due to doctrine, trauma, social justice concerns, or other factors, Unchurchable offers a space for those excluded from traditional spaces to engage meaningfully with faith. Clare\u2019s podcast journey expanded in 2023 with Survivors Discuss, co-hosted with Cait West and Shari Smith, where she dives into life after Christian patriarchy alongside two powerhouse voices in the deconstruction space. When not writing, Clare indulges her love for photography, explores Melbourne\u2019s galleries and bookshops, and occasionally tries her hand at stand-up comedy. Connect With Us!

      "description": "In this episode, I am joined by Dr. Camden Morgante. We explore the intricate intersections of faith, sexuality, and recovery from religious trauma, particularly in the context of purity culture. Dr. Morgante, a psychologist and author of Recovering from Purity Culture, shares her journey of navigating evangelical teachings that shaped her understanding of identity and sexuality, highlighting the disillusionment she felt as these teachings clashed with her experiences. The conversation challenges myths like the notion of \u0022damaged goods\u0022 after premarital sex, which perpetuate shame and hinder healthy relationships, especially for women. Dr. Morgante encourages listeners to reclaim their faith without shame, inviting them to embrace curiosity, self-reflection, and supportive communities on their journey toward healing and self-acceptance.

      "description": "Can balancing faith with personal freedom bring true inner peace? In this episode, we sit down with Elise as she shares her raw journey of growing up in a Pentecostal family, where she struggled to balance genuine friendships with heavy religious expectations. Elise opens up about the emotional toll of marriage, depression, and Bible college, highlighting the idolization of overwork in Pentecostal churches and its impact on her well-being. As she deconstructs her faith, Elise reflects on how therapy and self-reflection helped her redefine her beliefs and find safe, authentic spiritual spaces.\n\n\nMore About Elise\n\n\nElise is a Trauma-Informed Counsellor and Coach based in Melbourne, Australia, who is passionate about supporting individuals recovering from Religious Trauma. For decades, she denied her own humanity, constantly pushing herself beyond her physical, emotional, and spiritual limits, unable to say \u0027no\u0027 or slow down due to a deep fear of not being enough. Depression, anxiety, chronic low self-esteem, and perfectionism were her constant companions, while religion, a significant part of her life, only seemed to fuel her self-loathing. She internalised beliefs of being inherently sinful and unworthy of love, living in fear of eternal punishment if she fell outside of God\u0027s grace. This relentless need to prove her worth to God, the church, and herself eventually pushed her to the brink.\n\n\nGradually, Elise learned to embrace her doubts, questions, pain, and anger, as well as the joy, freedom, curiosity, and self-acceptance that came with letting go. Now, she is deeply passionate about walking alongside others as they reconnect with their own humanity, which is always deserving of love, care, and gentle compassion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect With Us\n\n  \u2022  You can find out more about Elise via her website - https://www.eliseheerde.com \n  \u2022  Or you can connect over on Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/eliseheerde/)  or Facebook  (https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=elise%20heerde%20-%20counsellor%20coach\u0026__epa__=SEARCH_BOX\u0026__eps__=comet.home\u0026__hcr__=eyJpZCI6IjEwMDA3NjU4Mjk4NjAzMCIsInNvdXJjZSI6IlRZUEVBSEVBRF9VU0VSX01BUktFUiJ9) \n\n\n\n\n\n  \u2022  To connect with Sam on Instagram - @anchoredcounsellingservices (https://www.instagram.com/anchoredcounsellingservices/) \n  \u2022  Want to contact with Sam about the podcast or therapy?

      "description": "What happens when devotion turns into oppression? Join us for a gripping episode of Beyond the Surface as we sit down with Ruth from snowy Connecticut, who bravely recounts her harrowing experiences growing up in a militant Catholic institution. Separated from her parents and subjected to the institution\u0027s extreme religious and political ideologies, Ruth\u0027s story is a powerful testament to the devastating effects of institutionalised abuse and religious indoctrination. Through her vivid recounting of physical, emotional, and psychological torment, we gain a deeper understanding of the traumatic impact of growing up in such a cult-like environment. Who Is Ruth? Ruth Reymundo Mandel has been in training and implementation since 1995. Her career began as a middle school teacher in post revolutionary Nicaragua. As a teacher in a developing, post war country she became dedicated to issues surrounding social justice and violence. She later transitioned to higher education and worked at the Bryman School and at The Art Institute of Phoenix as an Assistant Director of Admissions. Her responsibilities included vetting prospective students and identifying barriers to enrolment and to matriculation. After taking a break to raise her three children, she began working as a trainer and technical support for a national professional line nutritional company and an international professional line herbal company which trained medical professionals in alternative therapies. In her role she trained doctors and medical professionals in clinical application and was an ongoing support for successful implementation through patient outcomes. She developed systems for practice management, patient support, managed, created and promoted cyclical education events for clinical success. She developed training strategies to respond to a variety of real time field challenges. Ruth also worked as a professional business coach specialising in systems and practice management. Her dedication to understanding root challenges, institutional, structural and personal impediments which keep people from applying their skills and knowledge in a targeted and successful way helped many of her clients increase their business success. Aside from her professional accomplishments Ruth is a published poet, an artist, writer and a public speaker. Drawing on her childhood experiences growing up in an abusive, religious institution and as a survivor she is a fierce advocate for those who have experienced institutional abuse.

      "description": "In this episode, Laura shares her experience of being born into the fundamentalist group/cult known as The Truth, discussing the isolation, coercive control, and spiritual abuse she endured. We explore the unique challenges faced by women in these communities and Laura\u0027s struggle with identity. Laura reflects on her childhood values, teenage years without typical rites of passage, and the pain of leaving her family and community. She talks about her reintegration, dealing with C-PTSD, and finding her own beliefs. Laura also offers advice to those beginning their deconstruction journey. Who is Laura? With over 17 years of experience in accounting and finance, Laura founded the social enterprise and BCorp #GoKindly in 2018. An adventure motorbike rider and open water swimmer, Laura brings a dynamic perspective to her work. Raised in the 5th \u0026 3rd Generation inside The Truth/2x2s, a high-control, coercive fundamentalist cult, Laura has a unique understanding of religious control. A fierce feminist with an intersectional approach to life, Laura sits on the board of several grassroots, women-led social services organisations. Holding a BA in Chinese Language \u0026 Women\u2019s Studies and a BCom in Accounting \u0026 Finance, Laura is also a CA, CPA, and AAICD. With over 20 years of experience supporting women and young people leaving high-control religious groups, Laura has a deep interest in coercive control within religious contexts, drawing from over 30 years of observation. Laura writes blogs, provides commentary and context on religious and spiritual abuse conversations, and consults with family violence providers to support individuals leaving high-control religions.
