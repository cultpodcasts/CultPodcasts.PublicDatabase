      "description": "Join us for a profound exploration of healing religious trauma through the body, featuring insightful conversations with Liz Milani and Erica Webb. Liz, a former pastor and pastor\u0027s kid, shares her journey of navigating an involuntary deconstruction of faith, leading her to create a supportive community for others on similar paths. Erica, a somatic exercise coach and counsellor, brings her expertise on how purity culture and teachings of bodily mistrust contribute to a disconnection from the body\u0027s inherent wisdom. Together, we discuss the long-term impacts of religious trauma and the importance of reconnecting with and processing trauma through bodily awareness and mindful movement. Who Are Liz \u0026 Erica? Liz Milani is a writer, and the co-creator of the The Practice Co App. She lives for wholehearted, grounded spirituality, and to help people feel free to find God for themselves, in the world, in the lives they have. Liz lives on the Central Coast of NSW, Australia, with her partner, Jesse, and their three kids. Erica Webb is a registered counsellor, somatic exercise coach and highly sensitive person. She supports other highly sensitive women to discover their sensitivity superpowers and more confidently navigate the tricky bits of being a sensitive person in an often insensitive world. Erica combines her training in Behavioural Science, Counselling, and various mindful movement modalities, along with her understanding of the nervous system\u2019s role in trauma, pain and high sensitivity. She focuses on Self-Compassion, Kindness and Curiosity as key components to foster resilience as a sensitive human navigating the world.
