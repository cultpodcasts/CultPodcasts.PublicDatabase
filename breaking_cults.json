      "description": "From sensationalized portrayals to hidden truths, this pilot episode of the Breaking Cults podcast delves into the distorted depictions of Mormonism in popular culture. It features a theatrical audiovisual interlude taking us into the shadowy world of Mormonism\u2019s early days, bringing to life the mysterious and often manipulative tactics employed by its founder. In the second half, the episode shifts to an examination of women\u2019s agency in present-day fundamentalist sects, challenging the assumption that only men hold power in these systems. Join in as we unpack how both men and women participate in and enable cultic systems in this 20-minute deep dive.",
