      "title": "Boy, 12, Dead After Just 24 Hours at Wilderness Boot Camp, Found Without Pants",
      "description": "The parents of a 12-year-old boy think Trails Carolina might be just the place to help their son. Trails Carolina claims to be a Leader in Wilderness Therapy offering an Adventure Wilderness Program for children who have behavioral and or emotional difficulties. The parents say their boy is transported by two men from New York to Trails Carolina Camp at Lake Toxaway, North Carolina. Their son arrives at the camp in an agitated state. The 12-year-old is loud and disruptive, but he is assigned to a cabin with other children as well as four adults. In less than 24 hours, the 12-year-old boy from New York is dead. Sheriff Chuck Owenby says an autopsy is being conducted because the death \u0022appeared suspicious\u0022 since the boy died at the camp less than 24 hours after he arrived. A counselor explained to investigators that the boy was required to sleep on the floor inside a sleeping bag. The sleeping bag is inside a small tent called a \u0022BIVY.\u0022 According to search warrant documents, around midnight the boy started to experience a panic attack. After the panic attack, a counselor told investigators that the boy was checked on throughout the night starting at 12 a.m., with additional checks on his well-being at 3 a.m. and 6 a.m. At 7:45 a.m., the boy was found dead. According to the search warrant, when investigators arrived at the scene, CJH was stiff and \u0022cold to the touch.\u0022 He was lying on his back, his arms were on his chest, and his \u0022knees bent upwards toward the sky.\u0022 Also in the search warrant, investigators noted spots of bleeding under the skin, \u0022possible petechiae\u0022 in the boy\u0027s lips and eyes. This is considered a sign of asphyxiation. The warrant also notes a CPR mask was covering the boy\u0027s face and he was not wearing any pants or underwear. His pants and underwear were lying next to his shoulder Early in the investigation, detectives with the Transylvania County Sheriff\u0027s Office attempted to interview other juveniles at Trails Carolina when the boy died. However, camp staff members refused to allow investigators to interview or even see any of the other juveniles. Trails Carolina says the search warrant contains \u0022misleading statements\u0022 saying they won\u0027t discuss some details \u0022out of respect for the family and the investigation.\u0022 In a statement, Trails Carolina says they did not prevent children from speaking to investigators claiming they asked parents for permission for any children involved to speak with law enforcement and state agencies, and \u0022complied with each parent\u0027s preference. as we are required to do.\u0022 Children were moved to the area to protect them from seeing what was happening, not to avoid investigators. In response to the recent suspicious death of a 12-year-old at Trails Carolina, North Carolina health officials ordered the removal of all children from the nature therapy program.
