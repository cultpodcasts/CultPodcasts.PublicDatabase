      "description": "Hello everyone I hope you enjoyed our cult investigation on the twelve tribes/Yellow deli cult which is a international cult that owns several unlisted farms. We do not condone harassment of the twelve tribes cult no matter how ridiculous they are. I want to thank Sam_Sizemore on Instagram for all his hard work with going under cover and making the music. \nOur team spent a lot of time on this and avoided putting a commercial in for our Patreon so if you want to help support future projects check out the patreon, we also have a lot of other cool things for patrons. \n\nCheck out our new gaming channel Echo Gamer Media: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOMKnNsJaZEZ5Ga58q7DEsg\n\nOur new Patreon: https://patreon.com/ECMprod?utm_mediu... \n\nCheck us out on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/echo_chamber_media/\n\nWatch our Tik-Toks Before they get...Banned!: https://www.tiktok.com/@echo_chamber_media",
