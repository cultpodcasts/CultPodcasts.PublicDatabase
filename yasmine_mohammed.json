      "description": "Jezebel, an ex-Jehovah\u2019s Witness and Doomsday Cult survivor, spent over 20 years in the organization, enduring intense indoctrination, mind control, and emotional and mental abuse. Her experiences, including severe anxiety, depression, and eating disorders, are chronicled in two books written under her pen name.\n\nA lifelong historian and pro-freedom activist, Jezebel advocates for trauma survivorship and the sacredness of individual sovereignty. She promotes positive survivor mentality, emphasizing inner strength and gratitude, and educates others about the dangers of childhood indoctrination, mind control, deceptive propaganda, weaponized language, censorship, and totalitarianism.\n\nThrough her work, Jezebel aims to raise awareness and ensure that others know they are not alone in their struggles.\n\n\uD83D\uDCF8Follow Yasmine on Instagram @yasmohammedxx \n\n\uD83D\uDCD6Read Yasmine\u2019s story here\n\n\uD83E\uDEF6Support Yasmine\u0027s organization, Free Hearts Free Minds here \n\n\uD83C\uDF99\uFE0FListen to Yasmine\u2019s podcast to hear inspiring conversations with unsung heroes and unknown warriors who have survived insurmountable odds and overcome the most vicious of obstacles.\nSubscribe on Spotify here \nSubscribe on Apple podcast here\n\n\uD83D\uDC8CStay in touch \nWebsite: www.yasminemohammed.com \nEmail :confessionsofanexmuslim@gmail.com \n\n#Islamotrauma #Islamophobia #GenderEquality #FreeHeartsFreeMinds #ExMuslim #CultSurvivor #Freethinkers",
