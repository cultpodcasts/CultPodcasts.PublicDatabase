This is Kenya\u2019s doomsday cult where victims have crossed the 400 mark as detectives exhumed 12 more bodies on believed to be followers of a pastor who ordered them to fast to death in order to meet Jesus. Apparently the number of those who died has risen to 403, with 95 people rescued.\r\nPaul Mackenzie has been charged with murder after the bodies were found buried in shallow graves in the remote forest of Shakahola in the east of the country.\r\nSurvivors and victims\u0027 families have said Paul Mackenzie urged followers to fast in order to \u0022go see Jesus\u0022.\r\nHe and 29 others pleaded not guilty in a court in the coastal town of Malindi.\r\nMackenzie has already been charged with committing acts of terror, child cruelty and torture, which he denied.",
