While his mumu followers are passionately defending these supposed miracles, the evidence tells a different story. They show a complete lack of rational reasoning defending their cult leader.!We\u0027ll dissect the claims, expose the critical thinking flaws in these defences, and explore why so many people are drawn to these easily debunked events. Prepare for a no-holds-barred discussion as we separate fact from fiction in the world of faith and miracles.",

      "description": "Welcome to today\u0027s livestream where we critically examine the recent claims made by Jerry Eze at his London conference. In an event that has captured significant attention, Eze has asserted that he healed a child with cerebral palsy, allowing her to walk. However, a closer look at this so-called \u0027miracle\u0027 reveals a disheartening and, frankly, disgusting reality. While the child may have been able to walk, she has not been cured of cerebral palsy.\r\n\r\nAs an atheist committed to truth and rationality, we find it essential to challenge these narratives that exploit vulnerable individuals and perpetuate false hope. We\u0027ll dissect the claims, scrutinise the evidence, and discuss the ethical implications of such assertions. Join us as we seek to uncover the truth behind Jerry Eze\u2019s controversial statement and advocate for genuine, science-based understanding and support for those living with cerebral palsy.\r\n\r\nJoin in this great opportunity Want to create live streams like this?
