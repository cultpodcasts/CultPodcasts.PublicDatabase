Her parents had expected that she would ultimately return home and educate her siblings, and eventually her own children, but after making new friends, and going to see a therapist she says she began to realise that something wasn\u2019t right.\n\nSubscribe To Our Channel: http://bit.ly/SubscribeLADbible\nBe In Our Videos: http://instagram.com/ladbiblecasting\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ladbible/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ladbible/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ladbible\n\n#LADbible #UNILAD\n\nTo license this video please email: licensing@ladbiblegroup.com",
