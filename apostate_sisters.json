      "description": "Welcome to another fiery conversation with the Apostate Sisters! This time, we\u2019re diving into the tangled mess that is Purity Culture \u2013 that set of beliefs that told us our bodies belonged to God, our parents, or a future spouse, but certainly not to ourselves. Growing up in the Worldwide Church of God, purity wasn\u2019t just about abstaining from sex; it was about surrendering every ounce of bodily autonomy. In this episode, we share our personal experiences and dissect the messages that trained us to disconnect from our own bodies.\n\nWe talk about how purity culture is woven with manipulation tactics, shame, and fear \u2013 and we explore the serious psychological and relational consequences of growing up under these beliefs. From modesty expectations and guilt-ridden messages to the toxic idea that \u201Cpurity\u201D equals worthiness, we break down the impact these teachings had on our lives and the lives of so many others.\n\nJoin us as we reclaim our autonomy, call out the harm, and share steps toward healing. This one\u2019s for everyone who\u2019s been made to feel like their body was anything other than their own. Ready to challenge these damaging ideas? Let\u2019s get into it!\n\nJoin our Patreon: Patreon.com/ApostateSisters\nLinkTree: https://linktr.ee/apostatesisters",

With its over-the-top wholesome vibe and oddly staged smiles, it\u2019s clear that Herbert W. Armstrong had a vision of \u0022perfection\u0022 that was as controlling as it was unsettling. From the forced cheer to the choreographed moves, the whole setup feels like an eerie attempt to project an image of moral superiority and \u0022purity.\u0022\nJoin us as we cringe, laugh, and dissect the ways high-control groups often use aesthetics to enforce conformity and create a carefully curated \u0022perfect\u0022 world. What might seem like harmless dancing at first glance has us diving deep into the image Armstrong wanted his followers to project\u2014and the rigid control lurking behind that picture-perfect facade.\n\nTune in every other Friday night at 9pm Central for more live reactions to cult TV.

Growing up with the message that our sexuality is inherently \u201Cbad\u201D left us with shame and guilt, creating a disconnect from a natural part of being human. Even when teachings claimed that sex could be \u201Cgood\u201D within specific contexts, it did little to counteract the heavy shame we carried. We explore how purity culture robs us of a healthy, integrated sense of self, making it harder to feel whole and happy.\n\n#CultRecovery #ChurchAbuse #ChristianityHurtsPeople #PraiseJesus #HerbertWArmstrong #WorldwideChurchOfGod",

In our conversation, David shares insights from his mythicist perspective and discusses how attitudes toward atheism and mythicism have evolved over the last decade. We also touch on his creative endeavors, including writing erotica with his wife and his past musical career that earned him a spot in the Las Vegas Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nExpect some laughs as we explore the timelines of biblical figures, compare notes on ancient myths, and hear David\u2019s unique journey from faith to secular activism.

This time, Nancy and Patti are diving deep into a tough but necessary topic: spanking and physical punishment, and how these practices intersect with bodily autonomy, especially in high-control environments like the Worldwide Church of God (WCG). Growing up in a church where authority and obedience were emphasized, many of us were raised to accept physical punishment as \u0022normal\u0022 or even \u0022loving\u0022 discipline. But what are the real impacts of this practice on our sense of self, safety, and autonomy?\n\nIn this episode, we discuss:\n\nOur personal stories around spanking in WCG and evangelical households.\nHow spanking was justified by religious teachings and cultural norms, especially passages like \u0022spare the rod, spoil the child.\u0022\nThe psychological toll of corporal punishment on children, including struggles with self-worth, boundaries, and bodily autonomy.\nA look at shifting societal views on physical discipline and alternative, non-violent approaches to parenting.\nJoin us as we unpack the complex layers of spanking, authority, and control, and how we can reclaim our bodies and minds from these lasting imprints.

      "description": "Welcome to a new episode of the Apostate Sisters Interview Series, where we hold space for the life stories of those who were once entangled in the web of the Worldwide Church of God. Today, we\u0027re joined by David Ward, who was introduced to the church in his early childhood in the mid-1960s and left as a teenager in the late 1970s.\n\nRaised in a family deeply committed to the church after his father discovered \u0022The Plain Truth\u0022 magazine, David\u0027s upbringing was steeped in the doctrines and practices of the church, from observing the Sabbath to attending the impressive Ambassador Auditorium for holy days. Despite the church\u0027s deep influence, David recounts his journey with a reflective and critical eye, especially discussing his transition away from these beliefs during his pursuit of higher education.\n\nToday, while his mother and some siblings still observe the church\u0027s teachings, David identifies as an atheist, maintaining a nuanced view of his time within the church. This episode explores the complex dynamics of growing up in a cult, the allure of questioning, and the path to personal freedom. Join us as David shares insights into the everyday life aspects of cult membership, including youth camps, relationships, and the impact of church doctrines on personal decisions like dating and education.\n\nDavid\u0027s story is a testament to the power of questioning and the search for personal truth. As we unpack his experiences, we invite our listeners to reflect on their own journeys and the impact of religious teachings on personal growth and freedom.",

As survivors and former cult children, we, Patti, Nancy, and Joel bring unique insights and raw commentary on the writings of cult leader Herbert W. Armstrong. These texts played a crucial role in our parents\u0027 indoctrination and shaped our lives until we broke free.\n\nFor our premiere episode, we tackle \u0022The Missing Dimension in Sex,\u0022 a book notorious for its prudish yet paradoxically explicit discourse on what Herbert W. Armstrong deemed the \u0027New Morality.\u0027 Prepare for a rollercoaster of emotions as we dissect the bombastic language, doublespeak, contradictions, and disempowering messages peppered throughout this text. Not shying away from the nitty-gritty, this book dives into the mechanics of sex in a way that\u0027s as detailed as it is cringeworthy.\n\nGet ready to laugh, cringe, and maybe even get offended as we revel in our freedom, boldness, and the grand scale of our apostasy.

Don\u2019t forget to like, comment, and subscribe for more content like this!\n\nIn this revealing clip from our \u0022UnPack-It\u0022 series, dive into Herbert W. Armstrong\u2019s vision of the \u0022right society\u0022 through his distinctly Western-centric lens. The Apostate Sisters and MisterDiffiCULT dissect a passage where Armstrong champions his ideals, which reflect a narrow and biased viewpoint on societal structure.\n\nThis short video spotlights the critical discussion we have about the implications of such a biased perspective and how it shaped the teachings and practices within the Worldwide Church of God. Armstrong\u0027s views on building a society are not just dated but are steeped in a Western-centric ideology that we unpack with both seriousness and a touch of our signature irreverent humor.\n\n\uD83D\uDCCC Want to hear more of our thoughts on Armstrong\u0027s teachings and their impact on followers?

Armstrong\u0027s controversial views on sexual repression, as detailed in his book \u0022The Missing Dimension in Sex.\u0022 While Armstrong argues that societal sexual repression has led to a form of \u0027sex craziness,\u0027 we, the Apostate Sisters along with MisterDiffiCULT, find ourselves in a complex position of both agreeing and challenging his perspectives.\n\nJoin us as we navigate this provocative discussion, dissecting Armstrong\u0027s assertions with our unique blend of humor, insight, and irreverence. This clip offers just a taste of the critical and sometimes hilarious dialogue we engage in as we unpack the bizarre and often contradictory teachings from our former cult.\n\n\n\n#UnPackIt #ApostateSisters #MisterDiffiCULT #SexualRepression #CultLiterature #HerbertWArmstrong",

We explore the human aspect behind the spectacle, shedding light on the personal stories of those who grew up under the shadow of Armstrong\u0027s prophecy, particularly the year 1975, which was predicted to bring the end but instead left a legacy of confusion and disillusionment. This episode doesn\u0027t just recount historical facts; it aims to give voice to the silent echoes of childhoods spent in preparation for an apocalypse that never came. We focus on the real human cost of Armstrong\u0027s teachings, the individuals still grappling with the remnants of fear instilled from a young age, and those finding themselves ensnared in the web of Armstrongist cults today.

Whether you\u0027re a former member of the Worldwide Church of God, a history buff, or simply intrigued by the dizzying clusterf*ck of religious movements, this episode promises to deliver the Sisters\u0027 irreverent style.\n\n\n\nDon\u0027t miss out on this deep dive into the life of Herbert W. Armstrong. Subscribe, like, and share your thoughts in the comments below.

Growing up in a religious environment where the pursuit of truth was paramount, Patti embarked on a journey to understand the world more deeply, only to find discrepancies between what the Bible claimed and the realities of the world.\nThis is not just Patti\u0027s story; it\u0027s a conversation starter for anyone who has ever dared to question their faith, seek answers beyond religious texts, and find their own path in the pursuit of truth. #Deconversion #SeekingTruth #ReligiousQuestioning #ApostateSisters #FaithJourney #TheBibleIsCulturalFiction",
