He recently appeared on HBO\u0027s \u0022The Vow\u0022, which examined NXIVM, a self-help organization-turned-sex cult. Rick has intervened in more than 500 deprogramming cases in various countries. His book is called \u201CCults Inside Out\u201D which demonstrates many of the tactics the groups use for control and manipulation - and, more importantly, some of the most effective methods he and other experts have used to reverse that programming.\nhttps://culteducation.com\nhttps://twitter.com/RickAlanRoss\n\nlisten on\niTunes - https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id1441238966\nSpotify - https://open.spotify.com/show/4VTLG0HiIZaCjH9gE6NFPq\n\nhelp us make more money: https://bit.ly/koncretepatreon\n\nsponsors\nhttps://liquiddeath.com -  Use code KONCRETE at checkout to get a free koozie 2-pack with a 12-pack purchase.\n\ndanny\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jonesdanny\nhttps://twitter.com/jonesdanny\n\nmusic\nhttps://t.co/RkK5qH4ohI\n\nkoncrete\nhttp://twitter.com/koncrete\nhttp://instagram.com/koncrete\nhttp://facebook.com/koncreteinc",

      "description": "Ron Miscavige is the father of David Miscavige who is the leader of the church of scientology.  Ron and his family joined Scientology in 1970, and he worked for the Sea Org for almost 27 years.  It\u0027s also worth mentioning Ron signed a Billion year contract with the church.  This is really a tragic story of how a father became disconnected from his son, and then you throw in the whole scientology aspect of it and how the family originally got into this mess which eventually led to a broken bond between father and son. \nhttps://www.therealronmiscavige.com\n\nFollow the podcast on:\niTunes - https://apple.co/32Z5hQt\nSpotify - https://spoti.fi/331WFJ4\nGoogle Play - https://bit.ly/3hItzSZ\nSoundcloud - https://bit.ly/32VxAPU\n\nDANNY\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jonesdanny\nhttps://twitter.com/jonesdanny\n\nKONCRETE STORE: http://store.koncrete.com\n\nKONCRETE SOCIALS\nhttp://twitter.com/koncrete\nhttp://instagram.com/koncrete\nhttp://facebook.com/koncreteinc",
