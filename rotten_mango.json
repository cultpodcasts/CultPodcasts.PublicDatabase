      "description": "\u201CHey, can my dad stay with us for a little while after he gets out of prison?\u201D It was an odd request but Talia\u2019s roommates felt like they couldn\u2019t say no. Talia was a good friend, she always talked about wanting to become a lawyer and help people. She just had this tiny little quirk\u2026 She was obsessed with her dad. Even at parties - she would not stop talking about what an incredible man he was. He\u2019s just going to stay in their dorms while he looks for a new place. What could possibly go wrong? When Larry Ray moves into Talia\u2019s dorm - he slowly starts brainwashing all of Talia\u2019s friends. Soon, he will be sleeping in Talia\u2019s best friend\u2019s room. Encouraging the students to all have intimate relations with each other\u2026 while he watches. This would be the start of his decade-long college cult.
