      "description": "Many people have described social media as a cult. From following every word of an influencer to seeking the fame and fortune it can promise young people, the comparison is sometimes fair. However, in Southern California, an actual TikTok cult cuts members off from their families, gives the leader control of their finances, and forces them to live on cult-run properties, all in exchange for millions of follows and brand deals. The new Netflix documentary Dancing for the Devil not only explored the cult talent agency but exposed how Pastor Robert Shinn had been using those same tactics in his insulated Shekinah Church for nearly 30 years.",

      "description": "The Troubled Teen Industry has existed in the background for most of our lives. Whether you went to a camp, knew a friend who disappeared and attended for a while, or saw kids on Dr. Phil carted away, the troubled teen industry has cemented itself in broader American society. But in recent years, celebrity participants and other survivors have spoken out against the industry, alleging abuse, kidnapping, and even murder. However, with anywhere between 120,000-200,000 children in programs at any given time, these camps and centers can sweep everything under the rug. Utilizing cult tactics of brainwashing, false marketing, and attack therapy, the industry has garnered extreme supporters at the highest levels of government. What\u2019s truly behind this multi-billion dollar industry? Are these places good for changing a child\u2019s life, or are they trauma factories for the most vulnerable kids in our country today?",

      "description": "On December 13th, 1973, French Journalist Claude Vorilhon claimed to have met extraterrestrials named Elohim while walking along the Puy Lassolas mountain. The Elohim took him on his craft for 6 consecutive days and told him the truth about humanity: that there is no god, the Elohim created humankind in their image, and they wanted Claude to build an embassy for them when they arrived. He attracted a small following of sci-fi fans interested in joining his budding religious movement. Then, on October 7th 1975, the Elohim took him to their planet where they revealed that humanity was in the age of Apocalypse, that all previous prophets were alive through cloning on their planet, and that not only was Claude the brother of Jesus, but that he was the Messiah and was given a new name: Rael. What followed was nearly 40 years of growth, legal issues, jumping countries, and international hoaxes that kept the Raelian movement in the limelight. But is there something to Rael\u2019s claims about humanity? Does he even believe it, or is he scamming thousands of people into believing he is the last prophet? Support our Sponsors!
