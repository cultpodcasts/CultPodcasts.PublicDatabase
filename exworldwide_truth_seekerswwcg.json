      "description": "We often wonder when we get out of an organization if we really truly were in a cult.  We think of Jim Jones, David Koresh,  James Manson, etc. where people got killed for thinking they were following God through this man.  Well, there are signs of a cult which we\u0027ve gathered in here as well as the definition of a cult.  It\u0027s all very interesting.  After reading through these, we take the time to examine our cult next to the \u0022the list\u0022.  We\u0027re able to give a definitive answer after reading back through the list at the end.

Then being validated, often through counseling of some sort is very key and probably Step 3.  From there, healing can ensue as we continue to let go of the fear, the guilt, the lies, etc.  Sara tells about what it was like living under the heavy duty control in this mind bending, law driven, fear intense abusive cult. Dan and Angela (who was once in this cult) host the show and this is just the beginning, this being Episode 1 with Sara Ahrenholtz.  More to Come! \n\nAngela Clark is an Empower Her Life Coach.

      "description": "We can get sour and resentful within ourselves when life and the world doesn\u0027t give us what we think we deserve.  Many of us were taught in our religions that the world is an unsafe place and is bad and a depressing place to be in.  We need to change our mind about this so we can function in this world in a way that supports what we are here on earth to do - not just waiting for it to end.  We see everyone as separate from us.  We have to learn to love our neighbor as we love ourselves which IS loving ourselves.  Dr. David R. Hawkins teaches about what happens when our thoughts and vibrations (negative or positive) affects our body, our health and our feeling that life is good or not good.  So we want to strive to be in the flow with God type thoughts - Joy, hopeful, optimistic, peace, harmony, etc.  \n\nWebsite:  https://www.AngelasInspirations.com\nEmail:  exworldwidetruthseekers@gmail.com\n\nTO SCHEDULE A COACHING SESSION:  Email Angela:  angelasinspirations@gmail.com  \nWebsite https://www.AngelasInspirations.com (under construction) but can schedule your appointment here soon.\n\nCheck This Out:  ZOOM/PODCAST - SUNDAY MORNINGS - PROGRAM:  \u0022Spiritual Discoveries\u0022 with Dan \u0026 Angela Clark\n10:00am MST.\nZOOM/PODCAST LINK: https://us06web.zoom.us/j/87175205956...\nMeeting ID: 871 7520 5956\nPasscode: 777992\n\nDONATIONS Welcome:  Link:  https://paypal.me/CoachMe777?country....",

Men need to be able to open their hearts again and not be afraid to be emotional, cry, be sensitive. Women have been told to not be strong, courageous or bold - but encouraged to be weak with no voice but check out the Proverbs 31 woman. She wasn\u0027t at all weak or quiet!.

      "description": "Growing up in Worldwide left us without some of the basic tools of communicating properly in our relationships and due to how we were raised - we learned to stuff everything since were weren\u0027t allowed to say what hurt.  In fact - children were to be seen and not heard and were valueless as well as women.  But we can overcome this and take back the control of not only our emotions but our very lives and find some real freedom, learning how to be authentic and easily deal with the dysfunction.  But first, we have to see the dysfunctional in our families for what it is.  We have to overcome the abuse and call it what it was.",

When we were in Worldwide Church of God we didn\u0027t learn these important tools.  We were living in toxic and unhealthy relationships everywhere we went.  We left not feeling like we fit in in this world and not knowing how to function.  We knew we lacked something - but what?  We use real examples to make our point.  We\u0027re honest and real.",
