An Everyday Cult follows the arc of Buglion\u0027s journey through young motherhood into a group that welcomed her but also captured her mind, her heart, and her money. She shows us how a mind and psyche can be compromised by a controlling leader, using techniques that fly under the radar of human awareness\u2014and she implores readers to wake up to these ever-present abuses of power.
