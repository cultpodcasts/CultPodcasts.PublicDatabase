      "description": "#eastidahonews #daybell #trial \n\nBOISE -- A man who served on the jury in Lori Vallow Daybell\u0027s murder trial says he saw evil for the first time in his life while sitting in the courtroom with Daybell for five weeks.\n\nSaul Hernandez was juror number 8 and was assigned the seat closest to the witness stand from when the trial began on April 10 until a verdict was announced Friday afternoon. He and the 17 other jurors, including six alternates, sat directly across from Daybell.\n\n\u0022If there is a face to evil, it was hers,\u0022 Hernandez tells EastIdahoNews.com.\n\nDaybell was found guilty of killing Joshua \u0022JJ\u0022 Vallow and Tylee Ryan. Hernandez and his fellow jurors also found her guilty of conspiracy of murder in connection to the death of Tammy Daybell, her husband\u0027s former wife.\n\nHernandez sat down with EastIdahoNews.com reporter Nate Eaton for nearly an hour Wednesday morning at his Boise home to talk about his jury service, the evidence, witnesses, prosecution, defense and why he wasn\u0027t originally convinced that Daybell killed Tylee Ryan.\n\nListen to our entire interview in the video player above.\n\nIf you served on the Daybell jury and wish to share your story (on or off the record), email neaton@eastidahonews.com.",
