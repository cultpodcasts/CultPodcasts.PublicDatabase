Melody co-hosts as we talk to Jessica about her escape and her journey healing the trauma she endured as a member of this cult. There is a trigger warning as the subject of sexual abuse \u0026 rape comes up! I want to thank Jessica very much for her bravery to share this horrible experience. I am doing this pod-series as I had no idea how many of these cults are out there. How many people have been affected by them. I am thinking of dedicating a new Podcast to Cults and human trafficking survivors and deep divers into this dark world. Stay tuned for updates on that thought Cultimatum: a pod series dedicated to those survivors of cults and human trafficking is hosted by Anonymous Andrew \u0026 Melody. I want to thank Melody for her time and work behind the scenes. She runs a facebook group for cult survivors called Cult Escape \u0026 Recovery Support Group.

      "description": "EP#5 This is an original recording I did with a woman named Kat who rented a room to Jeff \u0026 Shaleia from TFU prior to when they started TFU. Below is the original description! Even the cover art is the original! EP#34 On this episode, we chat with a woman who rented a \u0022room\u0022 to Jeff \u0026 Shaleia back in 2016. At that time they were nobody. (Ok maybe still are?) At the time she had no idea who they were to become. This took place in Michigan (where they are based) but of course they hadn\u0027t started TFU yet. They were just two wandering nomads (double entendre) going from motel to house to car and in circles. You have got to hear this story. A great peak into the mindset of Jeff, possibly the most disturbed individual of our modern times. (Ok maybe some political figures and leaders of nations take that cake) But you can really get a picture of his goal to be a dominant figure in his demented world! I need more stories like this, so if you knew either of them prior to TFU please contact me. Of course you can be anonymous. After all this is the Anonymous Andrew Podcast! I want to thank Kat for stepping forward and sharing this experience with us.!

We are reduxing it it under the new podcast show Cultimatum. Laura Jenks came to me to share her story and concern with the Twin Flames Universe Cult. She felt that TFU was smearing the concept of a real Twin Flame Union. I would like to thank Laura for coming forward. Literally without her, our new podcast show Cultimatum might never have been born! Original description Ep# 28 I am disgusted by this Twin Flame Universe. I invite Laura Marie Jenks on this episode to discuss the concept of a twin flame and the Twin Flame Universe Cult. Laura is in a Twin Flame relationship by her definition. (Not one of TFU) She shares her concept and origin of the phrase \u0022Twin Flame\u0022. We hope to continue this conversation on this podcast. This organization needs to be outed further. Ultimately brought to their knees. If you are a family member or ex-member of TFU or know any knowledge, including the legal aspect of how they are getting away with this, and would like to be interviewed, please contact me.

Investigating \u0026 reporting the egregious practices, brainwashing, recruiting techniques etc. More importantly it is a safe haven for ex-members \u0026 survivors who were able to escape, leave and/or get out to tell their story. Many, if not all are traumatized and their lives are changed forever. Once out, they face the challenge of putting their lives back together. But these challenges that lie ahead of them are unimaginable. Anonymous Andrew from the Anonymous Andrew Podcast is joined my Melody, an ex-member of a cult herself to co-host this show. We hope this show brings awareness to the fact that cults around the US and worldwide are very much alive and thriving and preying on so many vulnerable people. We hope to also bring hope to this who might still be in a cult or being trafficked that there is hope and life on the other side! Melody and I (Anonymous Andrew) begin our journey on investigating cults from around the world and right here in the USA. It is amazing how many there are and how they get away with so much debauchery. Joins us as we expose these cults with ex-members and survivors who tell their story! You are not alone!
