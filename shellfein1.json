      "description": "In the 1970\u0027s, on Manhattan\u0027s upper west side, there existed a pyscho sexual therapy group known as the Sullivanian\u0027s  In later years characterized as a cult, the therapists advocated patients sleep with the therapists and cut off all contact with their families. Babies were forcibly taken from their mothers.  I was involved for five years. This is my story. (c) 2019 S. feinerman",
