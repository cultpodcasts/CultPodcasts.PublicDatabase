      "description": "Shirley Fessel is an advocate for women who have experienced religious-domestic v!olence. As a former minister\u0027s wife, she understands the challenges faced by women in these situations and the lack of support from institutional churches.\n\nAs a former minister\u0027s wife, she found herself trapped in a situation where the institutional church and the people in it failed to provide the support she needed. Determined to reclaim herself and protect her children from the horrors of @buse, Shirley decided to create a workbook that would help women in similar situations navigate the confusing tactics used against them, such as manipulation, gaslighting, and exploitation of faith concepts.\n\nThrough her own experiences, she learned the importance of leaving @buse without guilt, listening to her intuition, and not allowing others to minimize her connection to God. Shirley\u0027s work continues to support and empower women to overcome the attacks they face and honor their intuition. \n\nThis episode will be useful to anyone, but especially those who still identify as Christian and wish to understand where God is in their journey.\n\nRelevant Links: \n- Shirley Fessel\u2019s Book, Redemption from Biblical Battering, for Christian women: https://redemptionbb.com/book/ \n- Shirley Fessel\u2019s Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Fessup44/\n- Grant, (must Read the book to be considered): https://redemptionbb.com/grant/ \n- Text message service: To sign up, text the word \u0022courage\u0022 to 917-809-7311\n- Courage 365: Facebook Group - www.facebook.com/groups/courage365\n\n\n3 key takeaways for this episode\n\n1. Religious Abuse can be a complex and damaging form of domestic v!olence, often justifying @busive behaviors through religious beliefs and scripture. It is crucial for survivors to recognize the manipulation and seek support to break free from these toxic environments.\n\n2. Women in Abusive religious settings may face unique challenges in seeking help, as church authorities and religious beliefs may discourage them from seeking professional assistance. It is important for survivors to know that they have the right to seek professional help and should not be limited to only biblical counseling.\n\n3. The guest, Shirley Fessel, offers a practical resource in the form of her self-help workbook, \u0022Redemption from Biblical B@ttering,\u0022 which explores the seven levels of confusion and provides tools for women in religious domestic v!olence situations.

      "description": "Andrew Pledger @4ndrewpledger  is a survivor of a high control religious environment. Raised in the IFB (Independent Fundamental Baptist) church, he experienced trauma and internalized homophobia due to the system\u0027s teachings that being queer was demonic and needed to be prayed away. Andrew recognizes the harm caused by such religious environments, where individuals are blamed and shamed for any issues they face, while the system itself remains untouchable. He highlights the psychological and emotional abuse faced by queer individuals who may undergo conversion therapy or be subjected to self-hatred. Understanding the process of indoctrination, Andrew acknowledges the courage it takes to question and leave these systems. He calls for the dismantling of abusive systems, encouraging others to leave and reclaim their sense of self. Andrew emphasizes the importance of seeking support when leaving such environments in order to protect one\u0027s mental health and successfully embark on a journey of healing and self-discovery.\n\nRelevant Links: \n- Andrew Pledger\u2019s Resources: https://andrewpledger.mypixieset.com/links/\n- Andrew Pledger\u2019s Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/4ndrewpledger/\n- Text message service: To sign up, text the word \u0022courage\u0022 to 917-809-7311\n- Courage 365: Facebook Group - www.facebook.com/groups/courage365\n\n\n3 key takeaways for this episode\n\n1.
