      "description": "Paris Hilton\u2019s \u201CTrapped in Treatment\u201D is back for a second season with hosts Caroline Cole and Rebecca Mellinger Grone as they investigate the Worldwide Association of Specialty Programs and Schools (WWASP) - the largest global network of programs in the history of the troubled teen industry. Our first season\u0027s story continues with a look into how one man \u2014 a man who got his start at Provo Canyon School \u2014 masterminded his own universe of programs replete with allegations of abuse, isolation, and trauma that spanned from the arid deserts of Utah to the humid beaches of Jamaica. With first-hand accounts from survivors and interviews with former employees and industry experts, \u201CTrapped in Treatment\u201D Season 2 explores the complex nature of the troubled teen industry and the lack of justice for those that have lived through it.
