      "title": "Alleged Cult: Rashad Jamal and the University of Cosmic Intelligence",
      "description": "In a digital age it would make sense to have a digital cult. Rashad Jamal White uses multiple social media platforms to promote his school, The University of Cosmic Intelligence and enlighten his followers who he refers to as \u201Cgods and goddesses\u201D. Rashad Jamal claims to have a deep understanding in subjects from metaphysics to marine biology to world history. He is happy to share his thoughts, passions, and opinions\u2026for a price. Hundreds of thousands are tuning in, liking, subscribing, and paying for this knowledge that he frequently uploads from the Barrow County Detainment Center. That\u2019s right, this convicted sex offender is still largely influencing his followers and recently 6 of those confirmed followers have gone missing (including two children).\u00A0 That is in addition to 2 followers who have been linked to brutal homicides. Let\u2019s dive into the bizarre world of Rashad Jamal and his \u2018culty\u2019 University of Cosmic Intelligence and discuss the character parallels between this alleged cult leader and others. More importantly, let\u2019s spread the word and bring these 6 missing people back home. Make sure to tune in on Friday 2/2/2024 to listen to our interview with cult expert Rick Alan Ross.
