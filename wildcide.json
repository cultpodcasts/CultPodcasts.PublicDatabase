      "title": "The Fall River Cult Murders (Part 2): Hysteria, Corruption and \u0027Beyond a Reasonable Doubt\u0027",
      "description": "As this case evolves, it seems as if we are reading a work of fiction. Perjury, coercion, disregarded alibis, plea bargains, and life sentences without parole all play a role in these twisted, sensationalized murder trials. After 40 years, some of the police officials originally involved in the case aren\u2019t quite convinced of the final verdicts. Open your mind, get out the push pins and red yarn, and see if you can piece together what truly happened between October 1979 and February 1980. Is Carl Drew the self-proclaimed \u201CSon of Satan\u201D local pimp turned murderer that many believe him to be, or was he falsely convicted? Is this the East Coast\u2019s version of the West Memphis Three? Or are we looking at hardcore psychopathic killers who are guilty beyond reasonable doubt? Was this a legitimate Devil-worshipping sex cult or was it a dark but effective tool to manipulate and gain control? Try to keep a rational mind throughout this convoluted, complex, and twisted case. You\u2019ve never heard it like this before. Thanks for listening!

      "description": "In a digital age it would make sense to have a digital cult. Rashad Jamal White uses multiple social media platforms to promote his school, The University of Cosmic Intelligence and enlighten his followers who he refers to as \u201Cgods and goddesses\u201D. Rashad Jamal claims to have a deep understanding in subjects from metaphysics to marine biology to world history. He is happy to share his thoughts, passions, and opinions\u2026for a price. Hundreds of thousands are tuning in, liking, subscribing, and paying for this knowledge that he frequently uploads from the Barrow County Detainment Center. That\u2019s right, this convicted sex offender is still largely influencing his followers and recently 6 of those confirmed followers have gone missing (including two children).\u00A0 That is in addition to 2 followers who have been linked to brutal homicides. Let\u2019s dive into the bizarre world of Rashad Jamal and his \u2018culty\u2019 University of Cosmic Intelligence and discuss the character parallels between this alleged cult leader and others. More importantly, let\u2019s spread the word and bring these 6 missing people back home. Make sure to tune in on Friday 2/2/2024 to listen to our interview with cult expert Rick Alan Ross.
