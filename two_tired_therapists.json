      "description": "Get ready for the ascension, because we\u0027re diving into some uncharted territory with the wildest documentary that your favorite Two Tired Therapists have seen to date. But before the colloidal silver hits, Jackie is pulling her hair out over autocorrect making a mess of her texts, while Kyle\u2019s fed up with the body positivity movement, especially when tiny, skinny people are at the center of it. This week, we\u0027re unraveling the eerie story of \u0022Love Has Won: The Cult of Mother God.\u0022 Jackie gives a detailed account of this bizarre cult and its enigmatic leader, while Kyle breaks down the psychological aspects that made people fall for it. Later on, they play Fetch or Flop: Iconic Daytime Talk Show Edition.
