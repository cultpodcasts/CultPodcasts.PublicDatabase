      "description": "Synanon was initially a drug rehabilitation program founded by Charles E. \u0022Chuck\u0022 Dederich Sr., (1913\u20131997) in 1958 in Santa Monica, California. By the early 1960s, Synanon became an alternative community centered on group truth-telling sessions that came to be known as the \u0022Synanon Game\u0022, a form of attack therapy.\n\n\n Synanon ultimately became the Church of Synanon in the 1970s. Synanon disbanded in 1991 due to members being convicted of criminal activities (including attempted murder) and retroactive loss of its tax-free status with the Internal Revenue Service due to financial misdeeds, destruction of evidence, and terrorism.\n\n\n It has been called one of the \u0022most dangerous and violent cults America had ever seen\u0022.",
