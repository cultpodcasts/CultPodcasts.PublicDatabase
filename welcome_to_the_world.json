      "description": "One of the more common fears I hear about from my clients is that they will unwittingly fall victim to another group or organization that doesn\u0027t have their best interests at heart. Because of this, they have trouble opening themselves up to new ideas or engaging with group situations. In this episode, we discuss the reasons why this fear is misplaced, how it can limit us from having experiences that will be beneficial for our growth., and why you are actually inoculated from anyone ever taking advantage of you in this way again",

To those of us who have escaped from high control religions, the word \u0022faith\u0022 implies blind allegiance to a harmful belief systems that creates division and doesn\u0027t hold up to the slightest scrutiny. Today, we redefine and reclaim the word faith, and talk about the importance of cultivating your own personal belief system; one which will serve you and help you live a fuller life.",
