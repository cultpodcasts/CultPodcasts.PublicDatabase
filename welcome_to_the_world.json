      "description": "There was a time in my life when I rolled my eyes at the idea of therapy. It seemed ridiculous that simply talking with someone could ever lead to any kind of real change or improvement to my life experience. I\u0027m delighted to report that I was very, very wrong about that assessment. Today\u0027s episode is a bit of love letter to therapy. We talk about what is therapy, what it is not, how it can be helpful, what good therapy looks like vs bad therapy, and how to go about finding the right therapist (or counselor, or coach) for you. If you\u0027ve ever wondered what all the fuss is about, this episode is for you",
