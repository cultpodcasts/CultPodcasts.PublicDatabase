Dakota opens up about a life that was not only entangled with the controversial Oath Keepers but also shadowed by the dark clouds of gaslighting and abuse. Gaslighting, a form of psychological manipulation that seeks to make victims doubt their reality, is a theme woven into the fabric of Dakota\u0027s narrative. He recounts the harrowing escape from an environment marked by violence and chaos, where he and his siblings\u0027 perceptions were constantly manipulated. Dakota reveals the intricate layers of his father\u0027s personality, from the early days of criticism against political figures to a surprising evolution that ultimately led to Stewart Rhodes\u0027 involvement in the infamous events at the U.S. Capitol on  January 6, 2021. But it\u0027s not just a story of political activism; it\u0027s a story of survival. Dakota shares the devastating effects of gaslighting on a family, detailing the struggles of breaking free from a cycle of manipulation, fear, and isolation. Join Robin and Dakota as they unravel the complexities of Dakota\u0027s life, a life shaped by an organization founded on principles that devolved into chaos.

      "description": "On this episode, Dr. Robin Stern talked with her close friend and colleague, Alice Forrester, the CEO of Clifford Beers Community Health Partners. Alice discussed how growing up as a teenager in the 1970s, she was aware of the culture shift that was occuring at that time in our country, and how her father struggled with this changing dynamic.\u00A0 Alice recalled often being told she was wrong by her father, about certain opinions she was formulating at that time, and how that did not leave her unscathed.\u00A0 Alice and Robin unpacked Alice\u0027s feelings of being \u0022wrong\u0022 and how that has impacted her adult life. Alice shared a deeply personal account of when her nephew recently passed away at a young age from COVID and how she felt she couldn\u0027t say the right words to comfort her sister in her grief, and how this stirred up deeply emotional feelings of not being good enough.\u00A0 Alice also shared that at the same time, her marriage was going through a difficult time, and how she was being gaslighted by her partner regarding their relationship.\u00A0 Robin and Alice worked through the the idea that these multiple experiences of gaslighting can cause you to think that maybe you are wrong, and to second guess your own reasoning. Often, giving yourself space allows you to gain a better understanding of what is happening and spurs you to change or get out of the gaslighting situation.\u00A0 Alice shared how understanding what gaslighting means and what to look for, has helped her in raising her daughters in these unsettled times during the pandemic and post pandemic,\u00A0when we\u00A0 often are told to believe things that are constantly changing and things that we know are not accurate.\u00A0 To read the full transcript of this episode and to listen to other episodes, please head over to robinstern.com.\u00A0 And don\u0027t forget to leave a rating and review wherever you listen to this podcast!\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0",
