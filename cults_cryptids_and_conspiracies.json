      "description": "This week we finish our sad and grief stricken tale of the Remnant Fellowship. We go over more interpersonal failings within the church and its members and how in this case Religion is just a smokescreen to control those around you. As with all cults these tactics are dangerous so stay alert out there friends. Stay safe and enjoy some holiday cheer.

      "description": "This week we start a two parter about The Weigh Down Diet and the Remnant Fellowship. For Gwen Shamblin things looked real bad and without guidnace she chartered down a dark and abusive path. Remember your health is not tied to your weight no matter what some cultists may tell you. And your weight certainly has nothing to do with god. Be safe out there and look forward to part two next week.
