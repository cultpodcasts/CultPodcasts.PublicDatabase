Did he hold it sacred for over a decade? \n*Did the Lord prepare for the 116 lost pages of The Book of Mormon? Did Joseph Smith panic when the pages were lost because he knew he would not be able to reproduce them?\n*Was Joseph Smith\u2019s treasure digging an honest way to earn a wage, and evidence he was being prepared by the Lord to accept the angel Moroni? Was it an early sign he was good at spinning lies to convince people to give him money and power? \n\nThese are the questions I investigate here, but ultimately it is up for you to decide.  \n\n\nMany links below are Wikipedia links.

      "description": "The Mormon Temple Endowment is a sacred and central aspect of the religious practices within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). It is a ritual that takes place in LDS temples and is considered a deeply spiritual and symbolic experience for members of the faith. It is often criticized though for the strange cult-like aspects of the ceremony. Most members are completely surprised by this experience when going through the ceremony for the first time. \n\nThe endowment ceremony is designed to provide participants with knowledge, blessings, and covenants that are believed to be essential for their spiritual journey. It is seen as a step toward achieving exaltation, which is the highest level of glory and eternal life in the Mormon theology.\n\nThe endowment is typically administered to adult members of the LDS Church as they prepare for specific milestones in their lives, such as serving as a full-time missionary, getting married in the temple, or simply seeking a deeper connection with their faith. The ceremony involves a series of instructional and symbolic elements that are intended to teach participants about the purpose of life, the plan of salvation, and the eternal nature of God\u0027s love.\n\nThe endowment ceremony is highly symbolic, and participants go through a series of ordinances, including the washing and anointing, receiving a temple garment, and participating in various symbolic gestures and rituals. These elements are meant to convey spiritual truths, emphasize the importance of obedience, and instill a sense of sacred responsibility among participants. The ceremony has become somewhat more palatable overtime. Members complaints of the more radical aspects of the ceremony have caused the church to change the ceremony overtime.\n\nIt\u0027s important to note that the endowment ceremony has undergone changes over the years, with adjustments made to certain aspects to reflect evolving understandings and sensitivities. The LDS Church continues to emphasize the sacred and personal nature of the endowment experience, encouraging members to approach it with reverence and a sincere desire to draw closer to God.\n\n#exmormon #exmo #mormon #lds #utah #ldstemple #mormontemple\n\n- where to find me -\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@alyssadgrenfell\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alyssadgrenfell/\nBlog: https://www.howtoleavethemormonchurch.com/\nEmail me: alyssadgrenfell@gmail.com\n\n- support my channel - \nVenmo: https://venmo.com/u/Alyssa-Grenfell",

      "description": "Mormon garments, commonly referred to as temple garments or simply \u0022garments,\u0022 are special undergarments worn by adult members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) who have received the endowment ceremony in one of the LDS temples. These garments are considered to be a sacred and symbolic reminder of the covenants and commitments made during the temple ceremony.\n\nHere are key aspects of Mormon garments:\n\nPurpose and Symbolism:\n\nGarments are worn as a symbolic expression of the covenants made in the temple during the endowment ceremony. They are seen as a constant reminder of the individual\u0027s commitment to live according to the principles and teachings of the LDS Church.\nThe garment is often referred to as the \u0022garment of the holy priesthood\u0022 and is believed to have a spiritual significance, providing protection and a constant connection to one\u0027s faith.\nDesign:\n\nGarments are typically white and made of lightweight, breathable fabric.\nThe design includes a top and bottom piece, covering the wearer\u0027s shoulders, chest, and legs. The garments are meant to be worn under regular clothing.\nThey may have various symbols sewn into them, such as lines representing the navel and the knee, serving as reminders of one\u0027s commitment to obey the commandments and follow the path of righteousness.\n\nWhen Worn:\n\nMembers who have participated in the temple endowment wear these garments throughout their lives. It is common for members to wear them day and night, only removing them for activities like swimming, sports, or intimate relations.\n\nProtection and Blessings:\n\nMany members believe that wearing temple garments brings spiritual protection and blessings. The garments are seen as a physical and spiritual shield against temptation and harm.\nSome members share personal experiences attributing protection or guidance to their faithful wearing of the garments.\n\nPersonal Choice and Commitment:\n\nWearing temple garments is a personal choice, and members choose to wear them as a sign of their commitment to their faith and the covenants made in the temple.\nMembers often express a deep sense of personal significance and spirituality associated with wearing these garments.\n\n\nTranscript of the LDS Endowment Ceremony\nhttp://www.ldslearning.org/lds-mormon-temple-endowment-ceremony-text.pdf\n\n#exmormon #exmo #mormon #lds #utah #ldstemple #mormontemple\n\n- where to find me -\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@alyssadgrenfell\nBlog: https://www.howtoleavethemormonchurch.com/\nEmail me: alyssadgrenfell@gmail.com\n\n- support my channel - \nVenmo: https://venmo.com/u/Alyssa-Grenfell",
