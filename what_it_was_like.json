The police had raided them a few months earlier, but they\u0027d faced no investigation over multiple claims of child abuse. This is the story of how Lex had the cult\u0027s leader, Anne Hamilton-Byrne, hauled into court.\n\n\nWhat It Was Like TikTok (https://www.tiktok.com/@whatitwaslikepodcast)\n\nWhat It Was Like Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrSettPnKlvDr-iMiO2r3nQ)\n\nHosted by Julian Morgans (https://www.instagram.com/julianmorgans/?hl=en)\n\nA Superreal (https://superreal.com.au/) production\n\n\nHosted on Acast.

      "description": "Ben Shenton grew up in a religious sect in central Victoria called \u0027The Family\u0027. The children were told that their leader, Anne Hamilton-Byrne, was a reincarnation of Jesus Christ and were made to dress alike and bleach their hair. This continued until Ben was 15, when police raided the compound. Ben tells us about his life before and after that raid.\n\n\nYou can buy Ben Shenton\u0027s autobiography \u0027Life Behind the Wire\u0027 here (https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B0D5VK1VNR?ref=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_HKJYH7EXTP8MFX5Q7B3Z\u0026ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_HKJYH7EXTP8MFX5Q7B3Z\u0026social_share=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_HKJYH7EXTP8MFX5Q7B3Z\u0026skipTwisterOG=1).\n\n\nWhat It Was Like TikTok (https://www.tiktok.com/@whatitwaslikepodcast)\n\nWhat It Was Like Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrSettPnKlvDr-iMiO2r3nQ)\n\nHosted by Julian Morgans (https://www.instagram.com/julianmorgans/?hl=en)\n\nA Superreal (https://superreal.com.au/) production\n\n\nHosted on Acast.
