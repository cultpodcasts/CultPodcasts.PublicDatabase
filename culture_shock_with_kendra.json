      "description": "Hey Heathens! Serious question for you today... Can you spot harmful control tactics in your relationships that mirror classic behaviors of cult leaders? Being in a controlling relationship with your family or a significant other comes at a major cost and can leave a profound and negative impact on your mental health, quality of life, and overall wellbeing. Unfortunately, it\u0027s easy to get sucked into the loop of repeating toxic relationship cycles we witnessed during childhood and as adults we find that those relationships can feel eerily similar. In this episode, I break down controlling and authoritarian cult behavior and demonstrate what it could look like in your every day life. Resources from this episode include Dr. Steven Hassan\u0027s BITE Model of Authoritarian Control which you can download for free on his website https://freedomofmind.com/cult-mind-control/bite-model/ and all other material used for this episode can be found below: https://www.thehotline.org https://www.watchmojo.com/articles/top-10-mind-control-techniques-used-by-cults https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/07/12/what-makes-a-cult-a-cult https://thriveworks.com/blog/psychological-coercion-dark-traits-emotional-safety-relationships/ Join my Anti-Cult Club channel to get access to exclusive perks and chaos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqfiV3C_ALO-kdynhhm876Q/join #cult #cultleader #cultbehavior #cultsurvivor #religioustrauma #childhoodtrauma #cptsd #ptsd #rts #exfundie #exjw #exmo #healthyrelationships #toxicfamily",

You\u0027ll get to see an absolute blast from the past via OLD AF pictures of our youth that I found in the hidden vaults (the top of my closet under huge stacks of books). Jessalyn is a childhood friend and teammate from my homeschool volleyball days circa 2003-ish. We were both labeled as SUPER rebellious and told we were bad influences on the other girls. You\u0027ll be shocked at what we did to get those horrendous labels. We were raised in slightly different variations of a controlling fundamentalist group and I\u0027m honestly so proud we both managed to escape and become the strong, outspoken, rebellious, and hilarious women we are today. Cheers to all the other Jezebels like us out there!",

Unfortunately, Angela and several other young girls did not escape without life long scars including ptsd and religious trauma syndrome (rts) However, Angela and these other brave women are the reason he is behind bars which has protected so many others from his horrific crimes. We also dig into other things like how religious trauma can sneak up on you long after you\u0027ve left the environment and the heavy truth that ALL church goers (past and present) need to hear.

In this episode of [Cult]ure Shock, I had the pleasure of speaking with Mekael J., an ex-Mormon woman who left the church at age 37 when she came out as gay. We had an eye-opening conversation about her journey to embracing her authentic self and leaving a religion that treats homosexuality as a sin and worthy of excommunication. We also dug into the challenges that come with recovering from religion including losing family, how to reparent yourself, and the feelings of isolation and loneliness often attached. Mekael shared many of her personal experiences with me while offering valuable advice for others in similar situations.
