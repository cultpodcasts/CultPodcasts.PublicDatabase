I spent 6 months inside their private Facebook group and saw firsthand how easy is for people to fall head over heels for false prophets and promises. Is the 2nd coming of Christ (and his wife) psychologically manipulating good people in an online cult? I\u0027m convinced they are.

In this episode I talk to Lindsey Williams who was proximately featured on the show but *plot twist*, we aren\u0027t talking about the documentary... at least not in ways it\u0027s been talked about before. We dive head first into the precise tactics Bill Gothard used on children and families to bring in millions of dollars for his benefit, how obedience was a performance to recruit other families, and the non-stop brainwashing we all experienced. Lindsey also addresses how she was chosen by Gothard, and ultimately how she was able to escape the IBLP grasp. Gifts of support (linked on my page) are always welcomed with gratitude!

In the early 2000\u0027s, the IBLP brought in over 60 million dollars ($60,000,000) per year in revenue, largely in part to thousands of children providing free labor in addition to remodeling donated training centers. Other massive revenue streams include The Basic Seminar, Advanced Seminar, ATI (Advanced Training Institute), Character Curriculum, Embassy University (Disciplining Nations) and other IBLP materials/curriculum sold.

      "description": "Hey Heathens! Serious question for you today... Can you spot harmful control tactics in your relationships that mirror classic behaviors of cult leaders? Being in a controlling relationship with your family or a significant other comes at a major cost and can leave a profound and negative impact on your mental health, quality of life, and overall wellbeing. Unfortunately, it\u0027s easy to get sucked into the loop of repeating toxic relationship cycles we witnessed during childhood and as adults we find that those relationships can feel eerily similar. In this episode, I break down controlling and authoritarian cult behavior and demonstrate what it could look like in your every day life.

You\u0027ll get to see an absolute blast from the past via OLD AF pictures of our youth that I found in the hidden vaults (the top of my closet under huge stacks of books). Jessalyn is a childhood friend and teammate from my homeschool volleyball days circa 2003-ish. We were both labeled as SUPER rebellious and told we were bad influences on the other girls. You\u0027ll be shocked at what we did to get those horrendous labels. We were raised in slightly different variations of a controlling fundamentalist group and I\u0027m honestly so proud we both managed to escape and become the strong, outspoken, rebellious, and hilarious women we are today.

Unfortunately, Angela and several other young girls did not escape without life long scars including ptsd and religious trauma syndrome (rts) However, Angela and these other brave women are the reason he is behind bars which has protected so many others from his horrific crimes. We also dig into other things like how religious trauma can sneak up on you long after you\u0027ve left the environment and the heavy truth that ALL church goers (past and present) need to hear.

In this episode of [Cult]ure Shock, I had the pleasure of speaking with Mekael J., an ex-Mormon woman who left the church at age 37 when she came out as gay. We had an eye-opening conversation about her journey to embracing her authentic self and leaving a religion that treats homosexuality as a sin and worthy of excommunication. We also dug into the challenges that come with recovering from religion including losing family, how to reparent yourself, and the feelings of isolation and loneliness often attached. Mekael shared many of her personal experiences with me while offering valuable advice for others in similar situations.

Many don\u2019t agree\uFFFC that Kevin is as innocent and oblivious as his attorney wants you to believe. \n\nIn this video, I take you through two media interviews with Kevin\u2019s attorney, and show some information I found about in Kevin Franke\u2019s history, which may prove he\u2019s not so gentle after all. \uFFFC\nI give my perspective on Shari Franke\u2019s relationship with both of her parents, how difficult it is to go no contact with your family, how the church should absolutely be held responsible, and how the dynamic  between a narcissistic parent and the complicent\uFFFC parent can turn\uFFFC volatile. \uFFFC\n\nIt goes without saying that the opinions expressed here are my own and from my own personal experience of being raised in a highly religious family and in\uFFFC a really similar parental dynamic. \n\n\n\n*On August 30th 2023, Kevin\u2019s wife, Ruby, was arrested and charged with six counts of felony child abuse along side her business partner, Jodi Hildebrandt. \n After the arrest people rightfully wanted to know where the children\u2019s dad was, why he wasn\u2019t arrested, and why he still does not have custody of the Franke\u2019s 4 minor children.*\n\n\n(Sorry for the audio pops!!
